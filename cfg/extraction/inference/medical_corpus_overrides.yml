# Override config to disable temporal and spatial dimensions for medical corpus
# This config merges with the discovered schema to disable irrelevant dimensions
#
# Usage:
#   extraction:
#     dimension_config: "data/schema_discovery_mirage_textbook/final_schema"
#     dimension_overrides: "cfg/extraction/inference/medical_corpus_overrides"
#
# Rationale:
#   - Medical textbooks focus on domain-specific knowledge (diagnostic tests, procedures, etc.)
#   - Temporal/spatial extraction adds noise and increases processing time
#   - The discovered schema already contains 35+ medical dimensions that are relevant
