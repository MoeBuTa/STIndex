Te Waipounamu continues to have the highest weekly rates of ILI-related Healthline calls, however, rates have been decreasing overall since mid-September and are now similar to the national rate. Influenza continues to be the predominant virus among detections across most laboratories.\n\nTwo respiratory illness outbreaks were reported in the week ending 26 October, both in aged residential care facilities and with unknown pathogens. The outbreaks were in MidCentral and Capital and Coast.\n\nThe all-cause Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) hospitalisation rate in the Auckland region increased in the week ending 26 October but remains at the low activity level. Influenza (A predominant, A/H3 where typed) was the most frequently detected viruses among SARI patients. The influenza-positive SARI hospitalisation rate increased slightly but remains at the low activity level in the week ending 26 October. The PHF Science WHO National Influenza Centre reports a good antigenic match of circulating viruses to the seasonal influenza vaccine.\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2-positive SARI hospitalisation rate remains low and is lower than this time in 2024.

However, measles is often spread over times of high travel (like spring break, summer, or during holidays) or in situations where unvaccinated persons are in close quarters (like summer camp).\n\nKeep Reading History of Measles\n\nCDC publishes the cumulative number of measles outbreaks, defined as 3 or more related cases, that have occurred in the United States. Some states may have had multiple measles outbreaks, and a single reported multistate outbreak may have related cases reported in several states. States have the most up-to-date information about cases and ongoing outbreaks in their jurisdictions.\n\nMeasles is very contagious. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. You can get measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been. While measles has been eliminated in the United States since 2000, it is still common in many parts of the world.\n\nEvery year, measles is brought into the United States by travelers who get measles while they are in other countries. Travelers who are infected with measles can bring it back to the United States and spread it to other people who are not protected. These travelers are usually unvaccinated U.S. residents who travel internationally. Far less frequently, they are international visitors. Few cases this year have been reported among international visitors.\n\nA measles outbreak is defined as 3 or more related cases. Most outbreaks in the United States are small, comprised of 6 people or fewer, usually within a household. When measles gets into a community that has lower vaccination rates it can spread quickly, causing larger outbreaks.\n\nKeep Reading Plan for Travel\n\nTwo doses of MMR vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles, 1 dose is 93% effective.",

It is uncommon for someone who is vaccinated to develop measles. However, breakthrough infections (when someone becomes infected after they have been vaccinated) can occur, especially in communities experiencing an outbreak where high levels of measles virus are circulating. The number of breakthrough infections is consistent with what we have seen in previous years (approximately 10% of all measles infections).\n\nCDC is creating models to show how measles outbreaks could occur and spread in the United States. These models can be used to help health departments better identify communities at highest risk and manage healthcare resources.\n\nKeep Reading Assessing Measles Outbreak Risk in the United States\n\nMeasles is an extremely infectious, and potentially severe rash illness. Before the measles vaccine was introduced, an estimated 48,000 people were hospitalized and 400–500 people died in the United States each year.\n\nKeep Reading Measles Symptoms and Complications\n\nThe best way to protect yourself against measles is with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Talk to your healthcare provider about vaccination, especially if planning to travel.\n\nKeep Reading Measles Vaccination\n\nHistory of measles cases\n\nMeasles was officially eliminated from the United States in 2000, meaning there is no measles spreading within the country and new cases are only found when someone contracts measles abroad and returns to the country. Achieving measles elimination status in the United States was a historic public health achievement. The below figure illustrates how common measles was before vaccines and how vaccine policy enabled elimination.\n\nPrevious years\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, a total of 285 measles cases were reported in the U.S.",

It spreads easily when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. It can cause severe disease, complications, and even death.\n\nMeasles can affect anyone but is most common in children.\n\nMeasles infects the respiratory tract and then spreads throughout the body. Symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose and a rash all over the body.\n\nBeing vaccinated is the best way to prevent getting sick with measles or spreading it to other people. The vaccine is safe and helps your body fight off the virus.\n\nBefore the introduction of measles vaccine in 1963 and widespread vaccination, major epidemics occurred approximately every two to three years and caused an estimated 2.6 million deaths each year.\n\nAn estimated 107 500 people died from measles in 2023 – mostly children under the age of five years, despite the availability of a safe and cost-effective vaccine.",

Vaccination decreased an estimated measles deaths from 800 062 in 2000 to 107 500 in 2022 (1).\n\nEffects of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to setbacks in surveillance and immunization efforts. The suspension of immunization services and declines in immunization rates and surveillance across the globe left millions of children vulnerable to preventable diseases like measles.\n\nNo country is exempt from measles, and areas with low immunization encourage the virus to circulate, increasing the likelihood of outbreaks and putting all unvaccinated children at risk.\n\nWe must regain progress and achieve regional measles elimination targets, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Immunization programs should be strengthened within primary healthcare, so efforts to reach all children with two measles vaccine doses should be accelerated. Countries should also implement robust surveillance systems to identify and close immunity gaps.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\nSymptoms of measles usually begin 10–14 days after exposure to the virus. A prominent rash is the most visible symptom.\n\nEarly symptoms usually last 4–7 days. They include:\n\nrunning nose\n\ncough\n\nred and watery eyes\n\nsmall white spots inside the cheeks.\n\nThe rash begins about 7–18 days after exposure, usually on the face and upper neck. It spreads over about 3 days, eventually to the hands and feet. It usually lasts 5–6 days before fading.\n\nMost deaths from measles are from complications related to the disease.\n\nComplications can include:\n\nblindness",

They are more likely in children who are malnourished, especially those without enough vitamin A or with a weak immune system from HIV or other diseases. Measles itself also weakens the immune system and can make the body “forget” how to protect itself against infections, leaving children extremely vulnerable.\n\nWho is at risk?\n\nAny non-immune person (not vaccinated or vaccinated but did not develop immunity) can become infected. Unvaccinated young children and pregnant persons are at highest risk of severe measles complications.\n\nMeasles is still common, particularly in parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia. The overwhelming majority of measles deaths occur in countries with low per capita incomes or weak health infrastructures that struggle to reach all children with immunization.\n\nDamaged health infrastructure and health services in countries experiencing or recovering from a natural disaster or conflict interrupt routine immunization and overcrowding in residential camps increases the risk of infection. Children with malnutrition or other causes of a weak immune system are at highest risk of death from measles.\n\nTransmission\n\nMeasles is one of the world’s most contagious diseases, spread by contact with infected nasal or throat secretions (coughing or sneezing) or breathing the air that was breathed by someone with measles.",

The virus remains active and contagious in the air or on infected surfaces for up to two hours. For this reason, it is very infectious, and one person infected by measles can infect nine out of 10 of their unvaccinated close contacts. It can be transmitted by an infected person from four days prior to the onset of the rash to four days after the rash erupts.\n\nMeasles outbreaks can result in severe complications and deaths, especially among young, malnourished children. In countries close to measles elimination, cases imported from other countries remain an important source of infection.\n\nTreatment\n\nThere is no specific treatment for measles. Caregiving should focus on relieving symptoms, making the person comfortable and preventing complications.\n\nDrinking enough water and treatments for dehydration can replace fluids lost to diarrhoea or vomiting. Eating a healthy diet is also important.\n\nDoctors may use antibiotics to treat pneumonia and ear and eye infections.\n\nAll children or adults with measles should receive two doses of vitamin A supplements, given 24 hours apart. This restores low vitamin A levels that occur even in well-nourished children. It can help prevent eye damage and blindness. Vitamin A supplements may also reduce the number of measles deaths.\n\nPrevention\n\nCommunity-wide vaccination is the most effective way to prevent measles. All children should be vaccinated against measles. The vaccine is safe, effective and inexpensive.\n\nChildren should receive two doses of the vaccine to ensure they are immune. The first dose is usually given at 9 months of age in countries where measles is common and 12–15 months in other countries. A second dose should be given later in childhood, usually at 15–18 months.",

The risk of measles outbreaks is particularly high amongst refugees, who should be vaccinated as soon as possible.\n\nCombining vaccines slightly increases the cost but allows for shared delivery and administration costs and importantly, adds the benefit of protection against rubella, the most common vaccine preventable infection that can infect babies in the womb.\n\nIn 2023, 74% of children received both doses of the measles vaccine, and about 83% of the world's children received one dose of measles vaccine by their first birthday. Two doses of the vaccine are recommended to ensure immunity and prevent outbreaks, as not all children develop immunity from the first dose.\n\nApproximately 22 million infants missed at least one dose of measles vaccine through routine immunization in 2023.\n\nWHO response\n\nIn 2020, WHO and global stakeholders endorsed the Immunization Agenda 2021–2030. The Agenda aims to achieve the regional targets as a core indicator of impact, positioning measles as a tracer of a health system’s ability to deliver essential childhood vaccines.\n\nWHO published the Measles and rubella strategic framework in 2020, establishing seven necessary strategic priorities to achieve and sustain the regional measles and rubella elimination goals.\n\nWithout sustained attention, hard-fought gains can easily be lost.",

It is common in all parts of the world. Most people recover without treatment.\n\nInfluenza spreads easily between people when they cough or sneeze. Vaccination is the best way to prevent the disease.\n\nSymptoms of influenza include acute onset of fever, cough, sore throat, body aches and fatigue.\n\nTreatment should aim to relieve symptoms. People with the flu should rest and drink plenty of liquids. Most people will recover on their own within a week. Medical care may be needed in severe cases and for people with risk factors.\n\nThere are 4 types of influenza viruses, types A, B, C and D. Influenza A and B viruses circulate and cause seasonal epidemics of disease.\n\nInfluenza A viruses are further classified into subtypes according to the combinations of the proteins on the surface of the virus. Currently circulating in humans are subtype A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) influenza viruses. The A(H1N1) is also written as A(H1N1)pdm09 as it caused the pandemic in 2009 and replaced the previous A(H1N1) virus which had circulated prior to 2009. Only influenza type A viruses are known to have caused pandemics.\n\nInfluenza B viruses are not classified into subtypes but can be broken down into lineages. Influenza type B viruses belong to either B/Yamagata or B/Victoria lineage.",

When an infected person coughs or sneezes, droplets containing viruses (infectious droplets) are dispersed into the air and can infect persons in close proximity. The virus can also be spread by hands contaminated with influenza viruses. To prevent transmission, people should cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing and wash their hands regularly.\n\nIn temperate climates, seasonal epidemics occur mainly during winter, while in tropical regions, influenza may occur throughout the year, causing outbreaks more irregularly.\n\nThe time from infection to illness, known as the incubation period, is about 2 days, but ranges from 1–4 days.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nMost cases of human influenza are clinically diagnosed. However, during periods of low influenza activity or outside of epidemics situations, the infection of other respiratory viruses (e.g. SARS-CoV-2, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza and adenovirus) can also present as influenza-like illness (ILI), which makes the clinical differentiation of influenza from other pathogens difficult.\n\nCollection of appropriate respiratory samples and the application of a laboratory diagnostic test is required to establish a definitive diagnosis.",

However, these global figures hide significant disparity among countries of different income strata, with low-income countries lagging behind.\n\nMeasles, because of its high transmissibility, acts as an early warning system, quickly exposing immunity gaps in the population. Still, 20.6 million children missed their routine first dose of measles, far from the 2019 level of 19.3 million.\n\nGlobal immunization coverage 2024\n\nA summary of global vaccination coverage in 2024 follows.\n\nHaemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) causes meningitis and pneumonia.

Hepatitis B vaccine for infants had been introduced nationwide in 190 Member States by the end of 2024. Global coverage with 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine is estimated at 84%. In addition, 117 Member States introduced 1 dose of hepatitis B vaccine to newborns within the first 24 hours of life. Global coverage is 45% and is as high as 79% in the WHO Western Pacific Region, while it is estimated at only 17% in the WHO African Region.\n\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common viral infection affecting the reproductive tract and can cause cervical cancer in women, other types of cancer, and genital warts in both men and women. The HPV vaccine was provided in national immunization programmes and services in 147 countries in 2024, including new introductions in four countries. In 2024, 67 countries – representing more than 80% of girls aged 9–14 years old vaccinated in that year – used a 1-dose schedule. Global coverage with the first dose of HPV among girls is now estimated at 31%. While far from the 90% target by 2030, it represents a large increase from the 17% coverage in 2019.",

It remains one of the leading causes of death among children in sub-Saharan Africa. The Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP), coordinated by WHO and conducted in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi from 2019 to 2023 demonstrated high public impact with a vaccine-attributable 13% reduction in all-cause mortality among children age-eligible for vaccination and substantial reduction in hospitalizations for severe malaria. Since 2024, malaria vaccines have been further introduced in national immunization schedules and scaled-up across Africa as part of integrated malaria control activities.

By the end of 2024, 191 Member States had included a second dose of measles vaccine in their national immunization schedules.\n\nBacterial meningitis is an often-deadly infection which also leaves 1 in 5 individuals with long-term devastating sequelae after the acute phase. Before MenAfriVac introduction in 2010, meningococcus serogroup A (NmA) caused 80% of meningitis epidemics in the African meningitis belt. By end 2024, 24 of 26 countries in the belt conducted preventive campaigns, and 15 introduced MenAfriVac in their routine immunization programme, reaching 410 million people. Coverage is estimated at 60% in countries using MenAfriVac in routine immunization programmes and 29% overall in the 26 countries. No case of NmA meningitis has been confirmed in the belt since 2017. A gradual switch to a new pentavalent meningococcal ACWYX conjugate vaccine starting in 2025 will pave the way to make the meningitis belt history.\n\nMumps is a highly contagious virus that causes painful swelling at the side of the face under the ears (the parotid glands), fever, headache and muscle aches.

As of 2024, yellow fever vaccine had been introduced in routine infant immunization programmes in 38 of the 40 countries and territories at risk for yellow fever in Africa and the Americas. In these 40 countries and territories, coverage is estimated at 52%.\n\nKey challenges\n\nIn 2024, 14.3 million infants did not receive an initial dose of DTP vaccine, pointing to a lack of access to immunization and other health services, and an additional 5.6 million are partially vaccinated. Of the 19.9 million, around 55% of these children live in 10 countries: Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sudan and Yemen.\n\nMonitoring data at subnational levels is critical to helping countries prioritize and tailor vaccination strategies and operational plans to address immunization gaps and reach every person with life-saving vaccines.\n\nWHO response\n\nWHO is working with countries and partners to improve global vaccination coverage, including through these initiatives adopted by the World Health Assembly in August 2020.\n\nImmunization Agenda 2030\n\nIA2030 sets an ambitious, overarching global vision and strategy for vaccines and immunization for the decade 2021–2030.

Immunization currently prevents 3.5 million to 5 million deaths every year from diseases like diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), influenza and measles.\n\nImmunization is key to primary health care, an indisputable human right, and one of the best health investments money can buy. Vaccines are also critical to the prevention and control of infectious disease outbreaks. They underpin global health security and are a vital tool in the battle against antimicrobial resistance.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic strained health systems, resulting in dramatic setbacks. The most recent data for diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DTP) immunization coverage underscores the need for ongoing catch-up, recovery and system-strengthening.\n\nMeasles, because of its high transmissibility, quickly exposes immunity. In 2024, the routine first dose of measles vaccine was missed by 20.6 million children – far from the 2019 level of 19.3 million children.\n\nImpact\n\nVaccines train your immune system to create antibodies, just as it does when it’s exposed to a disease. However, because vaccines contain only killed or weakened forms of germs like viruses or bacteria, they do not cause the disease or put you at risk of its complications.\n\nVaccines protect against many different diseases, including:",

It was co-created with thousands of contributions from countries and organizations around the world. It draws on lessons from the past decade and acknowledges continuing and new challenges posed by infectious diseases (e.g. Ebola, COVID-19).\n\nThe strategy has been designed to respond to the interests of every country and intends to inspire and align the activities of community, national, regional and global stakeholders towards achieving a world where everyone, everywhere fully benefits from vaccines for good health and well",

Koplik spots may be seen on the buccal mucosa. Prodromal symptoms usually last 2 to 4 days. The most important clinical predictors are included in the clinical case definition for measles, which is an illness characterised by:\n\ngeneralised maculopapular rash, usually lasting 3 or more days, and\n\nfever (at least 38 °C if measured) present at the time of rash onset, and\n\ncough or coryza or conjunctivitis or Koplik spots.\n\nThe characteristic rash appears 2 to 7 days after the onset of the prodrome. It begins on the face before becoming generalised and usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Measles infection (confirmed virologically) may rarely occur without a rash. Other symptoms can include anorexia, diarrhoea (especially in infants) and generalised lymphadenopathy. People who have been previously immunised may develop attenuated infection with mild or non-classical clinical features, although this is uncommon.

Complications can include otitis media, pneumonia and encephalitis, which occurs in about one in every 1,000 infected people. Measles infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, premature labour and low birth weight infants. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is an extremely rare and delayed complication of measles, occurring in about one per 100,000 cases. SSPE usually begins about 7 years after the measles infection. It is characterised by progressive inflammation and degeneration of the brain and is always fatal.\n\nManagement of suspected cases\n\nPeople with symptoms of measles are advised to seek medical care, call ahead to the doctor or health facility and wear a mask when leaving the home. On arrival to the health facility, they should be identified and immediately diverted to a separate room for assessment under airborne precautions. Suspected cases should isolate at home until they’ve been advised whether or not they are a confirmed case of measles. Suspected cases should not go to work, school or public places (e.g. supermarkets).\n\nDiagnosis\n\nLocal Public Health Units (LPHUs) can provide advice on recommended testing for measles at the point of notification of suspected cases by medical practitioners which can include:\n\nserology (demonstration of measles IgM antibody)",

In addition to providing direct protection to the vaccine recipient, immunisation against measles results in the indirect protection of unimmunised people (herd immunity) if high enough coverage is achieved in the population. Vaccination has several major effects on measles epidemiology, including an increase of the mean age of infection and an increase in the time between epidemics. Endemic transmission of measles ceased in Australia by the late 1990s as a result of the two-dose vaccination schedule and widespread vaccination. In 2014 the World Health Organization verified that Australia had achieved elimination status for measles, defined as the absence of endemic transmission in a defined geographical area for ≥ 12months. Although measles is no longer endemic in Australia, there continues to be imported cases in overseas visitors and returning residents, with occasional onwards local transmission.\n\nInterruptions to global vaccination programs during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the resumption of international travel post-pandemic, have led to an increase in measles cases worldwide, heightening the risk of importation to Australia.\n\nControl measures for measles\n\nPreventive measures\n\nMeasles-containing vaccines are live attenuated vaccines.",

Outbreak control relies on early diagnosis and notification of cases, prompt isolation of infectious cases, and timely and effective identification of contacts, with provision of advice and PEP and/or quarantine, as appropriate. In defined groups of susceptible people, where exposure has occurred but it is too late or not feasible to identify individuals for whom PEP may prevent infection, widespread vaccination may be indicated to minimise ongoing transmission within the group. LPHUs alongside the Department of Health conduct detailed investigations of outbreaks.\n\nSpecial settings\n\nSchools and childcare\n\nAlthough outbreaks mainly affect unvaccinated children, highly vaccinated school or childcare populations have also been affected. Cases are excluded from school and childcare for at least 4 days after rash onset. Immunised contacts are not excluded. Unimmunised/non-immune contacts should be excluded until 14 days after the first day of appearance of the rash in the last case. If unimmunised contacts are vaccinated within 72 hours of their first contact with the first case or if they receive immunoglobulin within 144 hours of the contact, they may return to school.",

Initial symptoms are fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness of the neck and pain in the limbs. One in 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis (usually in the legs). Among those paralysed, 5–10% die when their breathing muscles become immobilized.\n\nPolio mainly affects children under 5 years of age. However, anyone of any age who is unvaccinated can contract the disease.\n\nThere is no cure for polio, it can only be prevented. Polio vaccine, given multiple times, can protect a child for life. There are two vaccines available: oral polio vaccine and inactivated polio vaccine. Both are effective and safe, and both are used in different combinations worldwide, depending on local epidemiological and programmatic circumstances, to ensure the best possible protection to populations can be provided.\n\nEradication\n\nThe strategies for polio eradication work when they are fully implemented. This is clearly demonstrated by the successful eradication of the disease in most countries of the world.",

This is clearly demonstrated by the successful eradication of the disease in most countries of the world.\n\nThe Polio Eradication Strategy lays out the roadmap to securing a lasting and sustained world, free of all polioviruses, and transition and polio post-certification efforts are ongoing to assure that the infrastructure built up to eradicate polio will continue to benefit broader public health efforts, long after the disease is gone.\n\nKey to success is ensuring the Strategy is fully implemented in all areas and is fully resourced. Failure to implement strategic approaches, however, leads to ongoing transmission of the virus. Endemic transmission of wild poliovirus is continuing in areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan. Failure to stop polio in these last remaining areas could result in global resurgence of the disease. That is why it is critical to ensure polio is eradicated completely, once and for all.\n\nOnce polio is eradicated, the world can celebrate the delivery of a major global public good that will benefit all people equally, no matter where they live. Economic modelling has found that the eradication of polio would save at least US$ 40–50 billion, mostly in low-income countries. Most importantly, success will mean that no child will ever again suffer the terrible effects of lifelong polio-paralysis.",

There is no specific treatment for dengue/severe dengue, and early detection and access to proper medical care greatly lower fatality rates of severe dengue.\n\nOverview\n\nDengue (break-bone fever) is a viral infection that is spread from mosquitoes to people. It is more common in tropical and subtropical than in temperate climates.\n\nMost people who get dengue do not have symptoms. For those who do, the most common symptoms are high fever, headache, body aches, nausea and rash. Most get better in 1–2 weeks. Some develop severe dengue and need care in a hospital.\n\nIn severe cases, dengue can be fatal.\n\nYou can lower your risk of dengue by avoiding mosquito bites, especially during the day.\n\nDengue is treated through pain management as there is no specific treatment currently.\n\nSymptoms\n\nMost people with dengue have mild or no symptoms and will get better in 1–2 weeks. Rarely, dengue can be severe and lead to death.\n\nIf symptoms occur, they usually begin 4–10 days after infection and last for 2–7 days. Symptoms may include:\n\nhigh fever (40°C/104°F)\n\nsevere headache\n\npain behind the eyes\n\nmuscle and joint pains\n\nnausea\n\nvomiting",

Other species within the Aedes genus can also act as vectors, but their contribution is normally secondary to Aedes aegypti.\n\nAfter feeding on a DENV-infected person, the virus replicates in the mosquito midgut before disseminating to secondary tissues, including the salivary glands. The time it takes from ingesting the virus to actual transmission to a new host is termed the extrinsic incubation period (EIP). The EIP takes about 8–12 days when the ambient temperature is 25–28°C. Variations in the EIP are not only influenced by ambient temperature but also by several other factors – such as the magnitude of daily temperature fluctuations, the virus genotype, and the initial viral concentration – which can also alter the time it takes for a mosquito to transmit the virus. Once infectious, a mosquito can transmit the virus for the rest of its life.\n\nHuman-to-mosquito transmission\n\nMosquitoes can become infected by people who are viremic with DENV. This can be someone who has a symptomatic dengue infection, someone who is yet to have a symptomatic infection (those who are pre-symptomatic), and also someone who shows no signs of illness (those who are asymptomatic).",

Most people are viremic for about 4–5 days, but viremia can last as long as 12 days.\n\nMaternal transmission\n\nThe primary mode of transmission of the DENV between humans involves mosquito vectors. There is evidence, however, of the possibility of maternal transmission (i.e. from a pregnant mother to her baby). At the same time, vertical transmission rates appear low, with the risk of vertical transmission seemingly linked to the timing of acquiring the dengue infection during pregnancy. When a mother does have a dengue infection when she is pregnant, babies may suffer from pre-term birth, low birthweight and fetal distress.\n\nOther transmission modes\n\nRare cases of transmission via blood products, organ donation and transfusions have been recorded. Similarly, transovarial transmission of the virus within mosquitoes has also been recorded.\n\nRisk factors\n\nPrevious infection with DENV increases the risk of an individual developing severe dengue.",

Routine vector surveillance and control activities and targeted community engagement greatly enhance resilience.\n\nVectors can adapt to new environments and climate. The interaction between the dengue virus, the host and the environment is dynamic. Consequently, disease risks may change and shift with climate change in tropical and subtropical areas, in combination with increased urbanization and population movement.\n\nPrevention and control\n\nThe mosquitoes that spread dengue are active during the day.\n\nTo lower your risk of getting dengue, protect yourself from mosquito bites by using:\n\nclothes that cover as much of your body as possible;\n\nmosquito nets, ideally sprayed with insect repellent, if sleeping during the day;\n\nwindow screens;\n\nmosquito repellents (containing DEET, Picaridin or IR3535); and\n\ncoils and vaporizers.\n\nTo prevent mosquitoes from breeding:",
