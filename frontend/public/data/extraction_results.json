It spreads easily when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. It can cause severe disease, complications, and even death.\n\nMeasles can affect anyone but is most common in children.\n\nMeasles infects the respiratory tract and then spreads throughout the body. Symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose and a rash all over the body.\n\nBeing vaccinated is the best way to prevent getting sick with measles or spreading it to other people. The vaccine is safe and helps your body fight off the virus.\n\nBefore the introduction of measles vaccine in 1963 and widespread vaccination, major epidemics occurred approximately every two to three years and caused an estimated 2.6 million deaths each year.\n\nAn estimated 107 500 people died from measles in 2023 \u2013 mostly children under the age of five years, despite the availability of a safe and cost-effective vaccine.\n\nAccelerated immunization activities by countries, WHO, the Measles & Rubella Partnership (formerly the Measles & Rubella Initiative), and other international partners successfully prevented an estimated 60 million deaths between 2000\u20132023. Vaccination decreased an estimated measles deaths from 800 062 in 2000 to 107 500 in 2022 (1).\n\nEffects of the COVID-19 pandemic",

Vaccination decreased an estimated measles deaths from 800 062 in 2000 to 107 500 in 2022 (1).\n\nEffects of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to setbacks in surveillance and immunization efforts. The suspension of immunization services and declines in immunization rates and surveillance across the globe left millions of children vulnerable to preventable diseases like measles.\n\nNo country is exempt from measles, and areas with low immunization encourage the virus to circulate, increasing the likelihood of outbreaks and putting all unvaccinated children at risk.\n\nWe must regain progress and achieve regional measles elimination targets, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Immunization programs should be strengthened within primary healthcare, so efforts to reach all children with two measles vaccine doses should be accelerated. Countries should also implement robust surveillance systems to identify and close immunity gaps.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\nSymptoms of measles usually begin 10\u201314 days after exposure to the virus. A prominent rash is the most visible symptom.\n\nEarly symptoms usually last 4\u20137 days. They include:\n\nrunning nose\n\ncough\n\nred and watery eyes\n\nsmall white spots inside the cheeks.\n\nThe rash begins about 7\u201318 days after exposure, usually on the face and upper neck. It spreads over about 3 days, eventually to the hands and feet. It usually lasts 5\u20136 days before fading.\n\nMost deaths from measles are from complications related to the disease.",

Caregiving should focus on relieving symptoms, making the person comfortable and preventing complications.\n\nDrinking enough water and treatments for dehydration can replace fluids lost to diarrhoea or vomiting. Eating a healthy diet is also important.\n\nDoctors may use antibiotics to treat pneumonia and ear and eye infections.\n\nAll children or adults with measles should receive two doses of vitamin A supplements, given 24 hours apart. This restores low vitamin A levels that occur even in well-nourished children. It can help prevent eye damage and blindness. Vitamin A supplements may also reduce the number of measles deaths.\n\nPrevention\n\nCommunity-wide vaccination is the most effective way to prevent measles. All children should be vaccinated against measles. The vaccine is safe, effective and inexpensive.\n\nChildren should receive two doses of the vaccine to ensure they are immune. The first dose is usually given at 9 months of age in countries where measles is common and 12\u201315 months in other countries. A second dose should be given later in childhood, usually at 15\u201318 months.\n\nThe measles vaccine is given alone or often combined with vaccines for mumps, rubella and/or varicella.\n\nRoutine measles vaccination, combined with mass immunization campaigns in countries with high case rates are crucial for reducing global measles deaths. The measles vaccine has been in use for about 60 years and costs less than US$ 1 per child.",

It is common in all parts of the world. Most people recover without treatment.\n\nInfluenza spreads easily between people when they cough or sneeze. Vaccination is the best way to prevent the disease.\n\nSymptoms of influenza include acute onset of fever, cough, sore throat, body aches and fatigue.\n\nTreatment should aim to relieve symptoms. People with the flu should rest and drink plenty of liquids. Most people will recover on their own within a week. Medical care may be needed in severe cases and for people with risk factors.\n\nThere are 4 types of influenza viruses, types A, B, C and D. Influenza A and B viruses circulate and cause seasonal epidemics of disease.\n\nInfluenza A viruses are further classified into subtypes according to the combinations of the proteins on the surface of the virus. Currently circulating in humans are subtype A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) influenza viruses. The A(H1N1) is also written as A(H1N1)pdm09 as it caused the pandemic in 2009 and replaced the previous A(H1N1) virus which had circulated prior to 2009. Only influenza type A viruses are known to have caused pandemics.\n\nInfluenza B viruses are not classified into subtypes but can be broken down into lineages. Influenza type B viruses belong to either B/Yamagata or B/Victoria lineage.",

However, these global figures hide significant disparity among countries of different income strata, with low-income countries lagging behind.\n\nMeasles, because of its high transmissibility, acts as an early warning system, quickly exposing immunity gaps in the population.

By the end of 2024, 191 Member States had included a second dose of measles vaccine in their national immunization schedules.\n\nBacterial meningitis is an often-deadly infection which also leaves 1 in 5 individuals with long-term devastating sequelae after the acute phase. Before MenAfriVac introduction in 2010, meningococcus serogroup A (NmA) caused 80% of meningitis epidemics in the African meningitis belt. By end 2024, 24 of 26 countries in the belt conducted preventive campaigns, and 15 introduced MenAfriVac in their routine immunization programme, reaching 410 million people. Coverage is estimated at 60% in countries using MenAfriVac in routine immunization programmes and 29% overall in the 26 countries. No case of NmA meningitis has been confirmed in the belt since 2017. A gradual switch to a new pentavalent meningococcal ACWYX conjugate vaccine starting in 2025 will pave the way to make the meningitis belt history.\n\nMumps is a highly contagious virus that causes painful swelling at the side of the face under the ears (the parotid glands), fever, headache and muscle aches.

As of 2024, yellow fever vaccine had been introduced in routine infant immunization programmes in 38 of the 40 countries and territories at risk for yellow fever in Africa and the Americas. In these 40 countries and territories, coverage is estimated at 52%.\n\nKey challenges\n\nIn 2024, 14.3 million infants did not receive an initial dose of DTP vaccine, pointing to a lack of access to immunization and other health services, and an additional 5.6 million are partially vaccinated. Of the 19.9 million, around 55% of these children live in 10 countries: Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sudan and Yemen.\n\nMonitoring data at subnational levels is critical to helping countries prioritize and tailor vaccination strategies and operational plans to address immunization gaps and reach every person with life-saving vaccines.\n\nWHO response\n\nWHO is working with countries and partners to improve global vaccination coverage, including through these initiatives adopted by the World Health Assembly in August 2020.\n\nImmunization Agenda 2030\n\nIA2030 sets an ambitious, overarching global vision and strategy for vaccines and immunization for the decade 2021\u20132030.

Vaccines reduce risks of getting a disease by working with your body\u2019s natural defenses to build protection. When you get a vaccine, your immune system responds.\n\nWe now have vaccines to prevent more than 30 life-threatening diseases and infections, helping people of all ages live longer, healthier lives.

Immunization currently prevents 3.5 million to 5 million deaths every year from diseases like diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), influenza and measles.\n\nImmunization is key to primary health care, an indisputable human right, and one of the best health investments money can buy. Vaccines are also critical to the prevention and control of infectious disease outbreaks. They underpin global health security and are a vital tool in the battle against antimicrobial resistance.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic strained health systems, resulting in dramatic setbacks. The most recent data for diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DTP) immunization coverage underscores the need for ongoing catch-up, recovery and system-strengthening.\n\nMeasles, because of its high transmissibility, quickly exposes immunity. In 2024, the routine first dose of measles vaccine was missed by 20.6 million children \u2013 far from the 2019 level of 19.3 million children.\n\nImpact\n\nVaccines train your immune system to create antibodies, just as it does when it\u2019s exposed to a disease. However, because vaccines contain only killed or weakened forms of germs like viruses or bacteria, they do not cause the disease or put you at risk of its complications.\n\nVaccines protect against many different diseases, including:",

Koplik spots may be seen on the buccal mucosa. Prodromal symptoms usually last 2 to 4 days. The most important clinical predictors are included in the clinical case definition for measles, which is an illness characterised by:\n\ngeneralised maculopapular rash, usually lasting 3 or more days, and\n\nfever (at least 38 \u00b0C if measured) present at the time of rash onset, and\n\ncough or coryza or conjunctivitis or Koplik spots.\n\nThe characteristic rash appears 2 to 7 days after the onset of the prodrome. It begins on the face before becoming generalised and usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Measles infection (confirmed virologically) may rarely occur without a rash. Other symptoms can include anorexia, diarrhoea (especially in infants) and generalised lymphadenopathy. People who have been previously immunised may develop attenuated infection with mild or non-classical clinical features, although this is uncommon. People who are immunocompromised, young children aged below 5 years, pregnant women and adults 20 years of age and older are at increased risk of complications from measles.",

Complications can include otitis media, pneumonia and encephalitis, which occurs in about one in every 1,000 infected people. Measles infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, premature labour and low birth weight infants. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is an extremely rare and delayed complication of measles, occurring in about one per 100,000 cases. SSPE usually begins about 7 years after the measles infection. It is characterised by progressive inflammation and degeneration of the brain and is always fatal.\n\nManagement of suspected cases\n\nPeople with symptoms of measles are advised to seek medical care, call ahead to the doctor or health facility and wear a mask when leaving the home. On arrival to the health facility, they should be identified and immediately diverted to a separate room for assessment under airborne precautions. Suspected cases should isolate at home until they\u2019ve been advised whether or not they are a confirmed case of measles. Suspected cases should not go to work, school or public places (e.g. supermarkets).\n\nDiagnosis\n\nLocal Public Health Units (LPHUs) can provide advice on recommended testing for measles at the point of notification of suspected cases by medical practitioners which can include:\n\nserology (demonstration of measles IgM antibody)",

In addition to providing direct protection to the vaccine recipient, immunisation against measles results in the indirect protection of unimmunised people (herd immunity) if high enough coverage is achieved in the population. Vaccination has several major effects on measles epidemiology, including an increase of the mean age of infection and an increase in the time between epidemics. Endemic transmission of measles ceased in Australia by the late 1990s as a result of the two-dose vaccination schedule and widespread vaccination. In 2014 the World Health Organization verified that Australia had achieved elimination status for measles, defined as the absence of endemic transmission in a defined geographical area for \u2265 12months. Although measles is no longer endemic in Australia, there continues to be imported cases in overseas visitors and returning residents, with occasional onwards local transmission.\n\nInterruptions to global vaccination programs during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the resumption of international travel post-pandemic, have led to an increase in measles cases worldwide, heightening the risk of importation to Australia.\n\nControl measures for measles\n\nPreventive measures\n\nMeasles-containing vaccines are live attenuated vaccines.",

LPHUs alongside the Department of Health conduct detailed investigations of outbreaks.\n\nSpecial settings\n\nSchools and childcare\n\nAlthough outbreaks mainly affect unvaccinated children, highly vaccinated school or childcare populations have also been affected. Cases are excluded from school and childcare for at least 4 days after rash onset. Immunised contacts are not excluded. Unimmunised/non-immune contacts should be excluded until 14 days after the first day of appearance of the rash in the last case. If unimmunised contacts are vaccinated within 72 hours of their first contact with the first case or if they receive immunoglobulin within 144 hours of the contact, they may return to school.",

There is no specific treatment for dengue/severe dengue, and early detection and access to proper medical care greatly lower fatality rates of severe dengue.\n\nOverview\n\nDengue (break-bone fever) is a viral infection that is spread from mosquitoes to people. It is more common in tropical and subtropical than in temperate climates.\n\nMost people who get dengue do not have symptoms. For those who do, the most common symptoms are high fever, headache, body aches, nausea and rash. Most get better in 1\u20132 weeks. Some develop severe dengue and need care in a hospital.\n\nIn severe cases, dengue can be fatal.\n\nYou can lower your risk of dengue by avoiding mosquito bites, especially during the day.\n\nDengue is treated through pain management as there is no specific treatment currently.\n\nSymptoms\n\nMost people with dengue have mild or no symptoms and will get better in 1\u20132 weeks. Rarely, dengue can be severe and lead to death.\n\nIf symptoms occur, they usually begin 4\u201310 days after infection and last for 2\u20137 days. Symptoms may include:\n\nhigh fever (40\u00b0C/104\u00b0F)\n\nsevere headache\n\npain behind the eyes\n\nmuscle and joint pains\n\nnausea\n\nvomiting",

Other species within the Aedes genus can also act as vectors, but their contribution is normally secondary to Aedes aegypti.\n\nAfter feeding on a DENV-infected person, the virus replicates in the mosquito midgut before disseminating to secondary tissues, including the salivary glands. The time it takes from ingesting the virus to actual transmission to a new host is termed the extrinsic incubation period (EIP). The EIP takes about 8\u201312 days when the ambient temperature is 25\u201328\u00b0C. Variations in the EIP are not only influenced by ambient temperature but also by several other factors \u2013 such as the magnitude of daily temperature fluctuations, the virus genotype, and the initial viral concentration \u2013 which can also alter the time it takes for a mosquito to transmit the virus. Once infectious, a mosquito can transmit the virus for the rest of its life.\n\nHuman-to-mosquito transmission\n\nMosquitoes can become infected by people who are viremic with DENV. This can be someone who has a symptomatic dengue infection, someone who is yet to have a symptomatic infection (those who are pre-symptomatic), and also someone who shows no signs of illness (those who are asymptomatic).",

Most people are viremic for about 4\u20135 days, but viremia can last as long as 12 days.\n\nMaternal transmission\n\nThe primary mode of transmission of the DENV between humans involves mosquito vectors. There is evidence, however, of the possibility of maternal transmission (i.e. from a pregnant mother to her baby). At the same time, vertical transmission rates appear low, with the risk of vertical transmission seemingly linked to the timing of acquiring the dengue infection during pregnancy. When a mother does have a dengue infection when she is pregnant, babies may suffer from pre-term birth, low birthweight and fetal distress.\n\nOther transmission modes\n\nRare cases of transmission via blood products, organ donation and transfusions have been recorded.

Routine vector surveillance and control activities and targeted community engagement greatly enhance resilience.\n\nVectors can adapt to new environments and climate. The interaction between the dengue virus, the host and the environment is dynamic. Consequently, disease risks may change and shift with climate change in tropical and subtropical areas, in combination with increased urbanization and population movement.\n\nPrevention and control\n\nThe mosquitoes that spread dengue are active during the day.\n\nTo lower your risk of getting dengue, protect yourself from mosquito bites by using:\n\nclothes that cover as much of your body as possible;\n\nmosquito nets, ideally sprayed with insect repellent, if sleeping during the day;\n\nwindow screens;\n\nmosquito repellents (containing DEET, Picaridin or IR3535); and\n\ncoils and vaporizers.\n\nTo prevent mosquitoes from breeding:",
