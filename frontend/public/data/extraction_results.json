Some states may have had multiple measles outbreaks, and a single reported multistate outbreak may have related cases reported in several states. States have the most up-to-date information about cases and ongoing outbreaks in their jurisdictions.\n\nMeasles is very contagious. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. You can get measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been. While measles has been eliminated in the United States since 2000, it is still common in many parts of the world.\n\nEvery year, measles is brought into the United States by travelers who get measles while they are in other countries. Travelers who are infected with measles can bring it back to the United States and spread it to other people who are not protected.

It is uncommon for someone who is vaccinated to develop measles. However, breakthrough infections (when someone becomes infected after they have been vaccinated) can occur, especially in communities experiencing an outbreak where high levels of measles virus are circulating. The number of breakthrough infections is consistent with what we have seen in previous years (approximately 10% of all measles infections).\n\nCDC is creating models to show how measles outbreaks could occur and spread in the United States.

It spreads easily when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. It can cause severe disease, complications, and even death.\n\nMeasles can affect anyone but is most common in children.\n\nMeasles infects the respiratory tract and then spreads throughout the body. Symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose and a rash all over the body.\n\nBeing vaccinated is the best way to prevent getting sick with measles or spreading it to other people. The vaccine is safe and helps your body fight off the virus.\n\nBefore the introduction of measles vaccine in 1963 and widespread vaccination, major epidemics occurred approximately every two to three years and caused an estimated 2.6 million deaths each year.\n\nAn estimated 107 500 people died from measles in 2023 \u2013 mostly children under the age of five years, despite the availability of a safe and cost-effective vaccine.\n\nAccelerated immunization activities by countries, WHO, the Measles & Rubella Partnership (formerly the Measles & Rubella Initiative), and other international partners successfully prevented an estimated 60 million deaths between 2000\u20132023. Vaccination decreased an estimated measles deaths from 800 062 in 2000 to 107 500 in 2022 (1).\n\nEffects of the COVID-19 pandemic",

The suspension of immunization services and declines in immunization rates and surveillance across the globe left millions of children vulnerable to preventable diseases like measles.\n\nNo country is exempt from measles, and areas with low immunization encourage the virus to circulate, increasing the likelihood of outbreaks and putting all unvaccinated children at risk.\n\nWe must regain progress and achieve regional measles elimination targets, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Immunization programs should be strengthened within primary healthcare, so efforts to reach all children with two measles vaccine doses should be accelerated. Countries should also implement robust surveillance systems to identify and close immunity gaps.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\nSymptoms of measles usually begin 10\u201314 days after exposure to the virus. A prominent rash is the most visible symptom.\n\nEarly symptoms usually last 4\u20137 days. They include:\n\nrunning nose\n\ncough\n\nred and watery eyes\n\nsmall white spots inside the cheeks.\n\nThe rash begins about 7\u201318 days after exposure, usually on the face and upper neck. It spreads over about 3 days, eventually to the hands and feet. It usually lasts 5\u20136 days before fading.\n\nMost deaths from measles are from complications related to the disease.",

This restores low vitamin A levels that occur even in well-nourished children. It can help prevent eye damage and blindness. Vitamin A supplements may also reduce the number of measles deaths.\n\nPrevention\n\nCommunity-wide vaccination is the most effective way to prevent measles. All children should be vaccinated against measles. The vaccine is safe, effective and inexpensive.\n\nChildren should receive two doses of the vaccine to ensure they are immune. The first dose is usually given at 9 months of age in countries where measles is common and 12\u201315 months in other countries. A second dose should be given later in childhood, usually at 15\u201318 months.\n\nThe measles vaccine is given alone or often combined with vaccines for mumps, rubella and/or varicella.\n\nRoutine measles vaccination, combined with mass immunization campaigns in countries with high case rates are crucial for reducing global measles deaths.

      "input_text": "case rates are crucial for reducing global measles deaths. The measles vaccine has been in use for about 60 years and costs less than US$ 1 per child. The measles vaccine is also used in emergencies to stop outbreaks from spreading. The risk of measles outbreaks is particularly high amongst refugees, who should be vaccinated as soon as possible.\n\nCombining vaccines slightly increases the cost but allows for shared delivery and administration costs and importantly, adds the benefit of protection against rubella, the most common vaccine preventable infection that can infect babies in the womb.\n\nIn 2023, 74% of children received both doses of the measles vaccine, and about 83% of the world's children received one dose of measles vaccine by their first birthday. Two doses of the vaccine are recommended to ensure immunity and prevent outbreaks, as not all children develop immunity from the first dose.\n\nApproximately 22 million infants missed at least one dose of measles vaccine through routine immunization in 2023.\n\nWHO response\n\nIn 2020, WHO and global stakeholders endorsed the Immunization Agenda 2021\u20132030. The Agenda aims to achieve the regional targets as a core indicator of impact, positioning measles as a tracer of a health system\u2019s ability to deliver essential childhood vaccines.\n\nWHO published the Measles and rubella strategic framework in 2020, establishing seven necessary strategic priorities to achieve and sustain the regional measles and rubella elimination goals.",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a text about measles vaccination and WHO's response. I need to extract the required fields: temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, and disease.\n\nFirst, temporal expressions. The text mentions \"In 2023\" and \"In 2020\". Those are dates, so normalized as \"2023\" and \"2020\" with type \"date\". Also, \"2021\u20132030\" is a duration, so normalized as \"P1Y\" (since 2030-2021 is 10 years, but the hyphen might indicate a range, but the user's example used P1D for a day. Wait, the user's example had \"P1D\" for a day. Wait, the original text says \"Immunization Agenda 2021\u20132030\" which is a span from 2021 to 2030. But the duration between them is 9 years. However, the user's instruction says for durations, use P followed by the number and unit. So \"2021\u20132030\" is a duration of 9 years, so P9Y. But the user's example in the first response had \"P1D\" for a day. Wait, the user's first example had \"On March 15, 2022\" normalized as \"2022-03-15\" as a date. So in this case, the \"2021\u20132030\" is a duration, so normalized as P9Y? Or maybe the user expects the start and end dates as an interval. Wait, the user's instruction says for intervals, use start/end. But the text says \"2021\u20132030\" which is a span, so maybe it's an interval. But the user's example in the first response had a date, not an interval. Hmm. Let me check the user's instruction again. For durations, use P1D, P2M, etc. For intervals, start/end. So \"2021\u20132030\" is a duration of 9 years, so P9Y. But maybe the user wants it as an interval. Wait, the text says \"Immunization Agenda 2021\u20132030\" which is a period from 2021 to 2030. So that's an interval. So normalized as \"2021-01-01T00:00:00/2030-12-31T23:59:59\". But the user's example in the first response had a date normalized as \"2022-03-15\" without time. So maybe for intervals, the user expects the start and end dates. But the text doesn't specify exact dates, just the years. So perhaps the interval is from 2021-01-01 to 2030-12-31. But the user's instruction says for dates without years, use the most recent year in the document context. However, in this case, the years are given. So maybe the interval is 2021-01-01 to 2030-12-31. But the user's example in the first response had a date normalized as \"2022-03-15\" without time. So perhaps for the \"2021\u20132030\" duration, it's a duration of 9 years, so P9Y. But the user's instruction says for durations, use P followed by the number and unit. So \"2021\u20132030\" is a duration of 9 years, so P9Y. But the text says \"2021\u20132030\" as a span, which is an interval. Hmm. Maybe the user expects the interval as start and end. But since the exact dates aren't given, maybe it's better to treat it as a duration. Alternatively, maybe the user wants the start and end as the years. But the user's example in the first response had a date, not an interval. So perhaps the \"2021\u20132030\" is a duration. So normalized as P9Y. But I'm not sure. Let me check the user's instruction again. For durations, use P1D, P2M, etc. So if the text says \"2021\u20132030\", that's a duration of 9 years, so P9Y. But the user's example in the first response had a date, not a duration. So maybe the \"2021\u20132030\" is a duration. So I'll extract that as a duration. Also, \"2023\" and \"2020\" are dates. So temporal entries would be \"2023\" as date, \"2020\" as date, and \"2021\u20132030\" as duration P9Y.\n\nNext, spatial. The text mentions \"WHO\" which is an organization, not a location. So no spatial entries. Wait, the text says \"WHO response\" but no specific locations. So spatial array is empty.\n\nEvent_type: The text talks about vaccination rates, outbreaks, WHO's response. The event_type categories include surveillance_update, risk_warning, etc. The text mentions \"risk of measles outbreaks is particularly high amongst refugees\" which could be a risk_warning. Also, the WHO's response and the Immunization Agenda could be a surveillance_update. So possible entries: \"risk of measles outbreaks is particularly high amongst refugees\" as risk_warning with confidence 1.0. Also, \"WHO published the Measles and rubella strategic framework in 2020\" could be a surveillance_update. So two entries.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention any specific venues like hospitals, clinics, etc. So venue_type array is empty.\n\nDisease: The text mentions measles and rubella. Rubella is not in the allowed categories, so it's categorized as \"other\". So the disease entries would be measles (category measles) and rubella (category other). But the user's allowed categories for disease include measles, influenza, etc., and other. So \"rubella\" is other. So two entries: measles and rubella as other.\n\nWait, the user's disease categories include \"other\", so any disease not in the list is \"other\". So the text mentions measles and rubella. So measles is category measles, and rubella is category other. But the text says \"rubella, the most common vaccine preventable infection that can infect babies in the womb.\" So the disease entries would be measles and rubella. But the allowed categories for disease include measles and other. So rubella is other. So two entries.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nTemporal: three entries: 2023 (date), 2020 (date), 2021\u20132030 (duration P9Y).\n\nSpatial: none.\n\nEvent_type: two entries: risk_warning and surveillance_update.\n\nVenue_type: none.\n\nDisease: two entries: measles and rubella (other).\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"In 2023\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2023\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"In 2020\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2020\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"2021\u20132030\",\n      \"normalized\": \"P9Y\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"duration\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"The risk of measles outbreaks is particularly high amongst refugees\",\n      \"category\": \"risk_warning\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"WHO published the Measles and rubella strategic framework in 2020\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles\",\n      \"category\": \"measles\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"rubella\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Based on current trends of measles vaccination coverage and incidence, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) concluded that measles elimination is under threat, as the disease resurged in numerous countries that achieved, or were close to achieving, elimination.\n\nWHO continues to strengthen the Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network (GMRLN) to ensure timely diagnosis of measles and track the virus\u2019 spread to assist countries in coordinating targeted vaccination activities and reduce deaths from this vaccine-preventable disease.\n\nThe IA2030 Measles & Rubella Partnership\n\nThe Immunization Agenda 2030 Measles & Rubella Partnership (M&RP) is a partnership led by the American Red Cross, United Nations Foundation, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Gavi, the Vaccines Alliance, the Gates Foundation, UNICEF and WHO, to achieve the IA2030 measles and rubella specific targets. Launched in 2001, as the Measles and Rubella Initiative, the revitalized Partnership is committed to ensuring no child dies from measles or is born with congenital rubella syndrome. The Partnership helps countries plan, fund and measure efforts to permanently stop measles and rubella\n\nReferences\n\n1.",

The user provided a text about measles and rubella elimination efforts and wants the JSON extraction based on the specified schema. \n\nFirst, I need to extract temporal expressions. The text mentions \"in 2020\" and \"2001\". Using the previous temporal references, \"In 2020\" normalizes to 2020, and \"2001\" is already a year. So those are dates.\n\nNext, spatial mentions. The text refers to \"Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network (GMRLN)\" and \"WHO\". \"WHO\" is an organization, so maybe the location type is \"organization\". But the schema's spatial location types include country, city, etc. Since WHO is an international body, maybe \"parent_region\" as \"global\" or \"international\". However, the example in the previous response used \"Western Australia\" as a parent region. Here, \"GMRLN\" is a network, so perhaps no specific location. Maybe \"Global\" as the parent region? Or maybe there's no spatial info here. Wait, the text doesn't mention specific places like cities or countries. So maybe spatial is empty? Or maybe \"WHO\" is considered a location. Hmm, but the schema's location_type includes \"other\" as an option. So perhaps \"WHO\" is a venue? Wait, no. The spatial extraction is for locations like cities, countries, etc. Since the text doesn't mention specific locations, maybe spatial is empty. But the user's previous example had spatial entries. Wait, the current text doesn't have specific locations, so spatial might be empty. But I need to check again. The text says \"Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network (GMRLN)\" which is a global network, so maybe \"Global\" as the parent region. But the schema's location_type includes \"country\", \"city\", etc. Maybe \"Global\" isn't in the enum. The enum for location_type includes \"other\", so maybe \"other\" with parent_region as \"global\". But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's no spatial info here. Let me check again. The text doesn't mention any specific cities, countries, or regions. So spatial might be empty. But the user's previous example had spatial entries. Wait, maybe the \"Global\" part is a parent region. Let me proceed with that.\n\nFor event_type, the text talks about strategic priorities, elimination goals, outbreaks, and vaccination efforts. The event_type categories include \"surveillance_update\" or \"risk_warning\". The mention of \"measles elimination is under threat\" could be a \"risk_warning\". Also, the text discusses vaccination coverage and incidence, which might be a \"surveillance_update\". So two entries here.\n\nVenue_type: The text mentions \"Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network (GMRLN)\" which is a laboratory network. The venue_type categories include \"other\", so maybe \"other\" with venue_name as \"Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network\". But the schema requires venue_name. Alternatively, if there's no specific venue, maybe it's not included. But the text doesn't mention specific venues like hospitals or clinics, so venue_type might be empty.\n\nDisease: The text mentions measles and rubella. The category for measles is \"measles\", and rubella is not in the enum. The allowed categories include \"measles\" and \"other\". So rubella would be \"other\". But the user's previous example had \"measles\" as a category. So for the text, \"measles\" and \"rubella\" would be extracted. But the schema's disease category includes \"measles\" and \"other\". So \"rubella\" would be \"other\". However, the user's previous example had \"measles\" as a category. So in this case, the text mentions both measles and rubella. So two entries: one for measles and one for rubella as \"other\".\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nTemporal: 2020 and 2001 as dates.\n\nSpatial: Maybe none, but if considering \"Global\" as a parent region, then \"Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network\" as location_type \"other\" with parent_region \"global\".\n\nEvent_type: \"risk_warning\" and \"surveillance_update\".\n\nVenue_type: Maybe \"other\" for the lab network.\n\nDisease: measles and rubella (as other).\n\nBut need to check the schema again. For disease, the allowed categories are measles, influenza, etc., and \"other\". So rubella is not in the list, so it's \"other\".\n\nNow, structuring the JSON accordingly.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"in 2020\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2020\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"2001\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2001\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles elimination is under threat\",\n      \"category\": \"risk_warning\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"vaccination coverage and incidence\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles\",\n      \"category\": \"measles\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"rubella\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

My task is to extract specific data points into the required JSON format.\n\nFirst, I need to look for temporal expressions. The text mentions \"2000\u20132023\" in the reference and \"15 July 2025\" in the news section. The first is a duration, so I'll normalize it to \"P23Y\" since it's from 2000 to 2023. The second is a date, so \"2025-07-15\". I should check if there are any other dates, but it seems those are the main ones.\n\nNext, spatial mentions. The text lists regions like Africa, Americas, etc., which are all continents. So each of those would be a country or region. But the user's schema specifies location_type as country, city, region, etc. Since these are regions, I'll categorize them as \"region\" with parent_region as \"World\" or maybe leave parent_region empty if not applicable. Wait, the example in the previous response had parent_region as \"Western Australia\" for a city. Here, the regions are continents, so maybe parent_region isn't needed. But the schema requires \"location_type\" and \"parent_region\" is optional. So I'll list each region as \"region\" type without a parent.\n\nFor event_type, the text talks about the Partnership helping countries plan to stop measles and rubella. This seems like a surveillance update or a risk warning. The category options include \"surveillance_update\" or \"risk_warning\". Since it's about planning and measuring efforts, \"surveillance_update\" might fit better. Confidence is 1.0 as it's a direct mention.\n\nVenue_type isn't mentioned here, so the array will be empty. The disease mentions are measles and rubella. The user's categories include \"measles\" and \"other\" for rubella. So I'll list both, with measles as \"measles\" and rubella as \"other\". The disease_code isn't provided, so I'll leave it as an empty string or maybe use a code if known. Since the user didn't specify, I'll omit it or set to empty.\n\nPutting it all together, I need to structure each extracted element into the JSON as per the schema. Make sure all required fields are present and enums are correctly used. Check for any missed elements and ensure the JSON is valid.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"2000\u20132023\",\n      \"normalized\": \"P23Y\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"duration\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"15 July 2025\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2025-07-15\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Africa\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Americas\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Eastern Mediterranean\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Europe\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"South-East Asia\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Western Pacific\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"The Partnership helps countries plan, fund and measure efforts to permanently stop measles and rubella\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles\",\n      \"category\": \"measles\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"rubella\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a JSON schema and a previous example, but the current input is a webpage snippet from the WHO site. The task is to extract specific fields: temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, and disease.\n\nFirst, looking at the input text: \"When autocomplete results are available use up and down arrows to review and enter to select.\" This seems like a UI instruction, not relevant for extraction. Then there's \"Home\" and other navigation links, which are probably not containing any of the required data. \n\nThe next part mentions \"Dengue\" and \"Mpox\" as popular topics, and regions like Africa, Americas, etc. But these are just headings or categories. The \"Latest\" section lists disease outbreak news, situation reports, etc., but no specific events. The \"Disease Outbreak News\" link might be a potential source, but the text provided doesn't include any actual outbreak details. \n\nLooking for temporal expressions: there's no date, time, or duration mentioned in the given text. The user's previous example had a date, but here, the text doesn't have any. So temporal array would be empty.\n\nSpatial mentions: The regions listed (Africa, Americas, etc.) are parent regions, but the text doesn't specify a location type like city or country. So spatial might not have entries here.\n\nEvent_type: The text mentions \"Disease Outbreak News\" and \"Situation reports,\" which could relate to outbreak_alert or surveillance_update. But without specific event details, it's hard to categorize. The previous example had an event_type, but here, maybe \"outbreak_alert\" with low confidence?\n\nVenue_type: There's no mention of venues like hospitals or clinics in the text provided. So venue_type would be empty.\n\nDisease: The text lists diseases like Dengue and Mpox, which are in the allowed categories. So disease entries for Dengue and Mpox with category \"dengue\" and \"mpox\" respectively, and disease_code as their codes if known. But the user's previous example used \"measles\" with category and code. However, in the given text, there's no code mentioned, so maybe leave disease_code as empty or use \"other\" if not applicable. Wait, the schema requires disease_code, but the example in the history had \"disease_code\": \"B01\" for measles. However, in the current input, the text just mentions the disease names without codes. So perhaps the disease entries would have category as \"dengue\" and \"mpox\" with disease_code as empty or maybe using the ICD-10 codes. But since the text doesn't provide codes, maybe set disease_code to empty string or \"other\"? The schema requires disease_code, so maybe it's better to include it as empty.\n\nBut the user's previous example had \"disease_code\": \"B01\" for measles. However, in the current input, the text doesn't mention any specific disease codes. So perhaps the disease entries would be for Dengue and Mpox with category and disease_code as empty. Wait, the schema requires disease_code, so maybe it's mandatory. But the user's previous example had it. So in this case, since the text mentions Dengue and Mpox, but no codes, maybe set disease_code to empty string. However, the schema's required fields include disease_code, so it's necessary. But the user's example had \"disease_code\": \"B01\" for measles. So perhaps in this case, the disease_code is not provided, so maybe leave it as empty. But the schema requires it, so maybe the user expects it. Alternatively, maybe the disease_code is not required, but the schema says it is. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. \n\nIn the absence of specific codes, perhaps the best is to list the disease names with category and leave disease_code as empty. But the schema requires it. So maybe the answer would have disease entries with category and disease_code as empty. However, the user's previous example had disease_code, so maybe the assistant should include it even if empty. \n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would have disease entries for Dengue and Mpox with category and disease_code as empty. But the user's example had \"other\" for disease when not applicable. Wait, the previous example had \"measles\" with category \"measles\" and disease_code \"B01\". So in this case, for Dengue, the category is \"dengue\" and disease_code would be \"A15\" (ICD-10 code for Dengue). Similarly, Mpox is \"B03\" (ICD-10 code for Smallpox, but Mpox is a different virus, so maybe the code is different. However, the user's schema allows \"other\" as a category. Wait, the disease categories include \"dengue\" and \"mpox\" as options. So if the text mentions \"Dengue\", the category is \"dengue\", and disease_code would be the ICD-10 code. But since the text doesn't provide the code, maybe the assistant should leave it as empty. However, the schema requires disease_code, so perhaps it's better to include it as empty. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant should use the category and leave disease_code as empty. But the schema requires it. So the answer would have disease entries with category and disease_code as empty. But the user's previous example had disease_code filled. So perhaps the assistant should include the code even if not present. \n\nIn conclusion, the JSON would have disease entries for Dengue and Mpox with category and disease_code as empty, but since the schema requires disease_code, it's necessary to include it. However, without specific codes, the assistant might have to leave it as empty. \n\nSo the final JSON would have empty arrays for temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, and disease entries with category and disease_code as empty. But the user's previous example had entries, so maybe the assistant should check if any of the text mentions diseases. The text mentions \"Dengue\" and \"Mpox\" as topics, so those would be the disease entries. The disease_code for Dengue is A15, and for Mpox, it's B03 (though Mpox is a different virus, but the category is \"mpox\"). So the assistant should map those. \n\nTherefore, the disease array would have entries for Dengue and Mpox with their respective categories and disease codes. But since the text doesn't mention the codes, maybe the assistant should use the category and leave disease_code as empty. However, the schema requires disease_code, so perhaps the assistant should include it as empty. \n\nIn the end, the JSON would have the disease entries with category and disease_code as empty, but the user's example had disease_code filled. So maybe the assistant should use the category and leave disease_code as empty. \n\nSo the final answer would have the disease array with entries for Dengue and Mpox, each with category and disease_code as empty. But the schema requires disease_code, so it's necessary to include it. Therefore, the assistant should include the disease_code as empty strings.\n</think>\n\n{\"temporal\":[],\"spatial\":[],\"event_type\":[],\"venue_type\":[],\"disease\":[{\"text\":\"Dengue\",\"category\":\"dengue\",\"disease_code\":\"\"},{\"text\":\"Mpox\",\"category\":\"mpox\",\"disease_code\":\"\"}]}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a list of links and some text about influenza. The task is to extract specific information into JSON based on the given schema.\n\nFirst, looking at the temporal extraction. The text mentions \"28 February 2025\" which is a date. I need to normalize it to ISO 8601 format. So that becomes \"2025-02-28\" with type \"date\".\n\nNext, spatial. The text doesn't mention any specific locations, so the spatial array should be empty.\n\nFor event_type, the content is about seasonal influenza facts. There's no mention of an event like an outbreak or case report, so maybe \"surveillance_update\" fits here. But the confidence might be low since it's not explicitly stated. Wait, the user's example had \"risk_warning\" with confidence 0.8. Maybe here it's a surveillance update. Let me check the categories again. The allowed categories include surveillance_update. So I'll set category as \"surveillance_update\" with confidence 0.8.\n\nVenue_type isn't mentioned here, so the array remains empty.\n\nDisease is clearly influenza. The category should be \"influenza\". The text says \"seasonal influenza\", so the disease code might be ICD-10 code J09-J11, but since it's not specified, maybe leave disease_code as empty or use a placeholder. However, the schema requires disease_code. Since it's not provided, perhaps omit it? Wait, the required fields are text, category, disease_code. But the user's example had \"measles\" with category and disease_code. Wait, looking back at the schema, the required fields for disease are text, category, disease_code. But in the user's previous example, they had \"measles\" with category and disease_code as \"B05\" maybe? Wait, the user's example had \"measles\" with category \"measles\" and disease_code as \"B05\"? Wait, no, in the previous example, the disease was measles, category measles, and disease_code was \"B05\"? Wait, the user's example had:\n\n\"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles\",\n      \"category\": \"measles\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ]\n\nWait, but in the schema provided, the disease requires disease_code. However, in the user's previous example, they didn't include disease_code. Wait, looking at the schema again:\n\nFor disease, the required fields are text, category, disease_code. But in the user's previous example, they only had text and category. That might be an error. But the user's current query's schema says disease requires text, category, disease_code. So I need to include disease_code. However, the text doesn't provide a code, so maybe leave it as an empty string or omit? But the schema says required. Hmm. Maybe the user expects that if not present, it's left as an empty string. So for influenza, category is \"influenza\", and disease_code could be \"J09\" (ICD-10 for influenza). But since the text doesn't specify, perhaps leave it as empty. Wait, but the schema requires it. So maybe set disease_code as empty string. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that if not present, it's omitted. But according to the schema, it's required. So I'll have to include it, even if it's empty. But the user's previous example didn't have disease_code. Maybe the schema in the current query is different. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the current schema provided by the user:\n\nFor disease, the required fields are text, category, disease_code. So all three are required. But in the previous example, the user's response didn't include disease_code. That might be an inconsistency. However, the user's current query's schema requires disease_code. So I need to include it. Since the text doesn't mention a code, perhaps leave it as an empty string. So for the influenza entry, disease_code is empty.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\ntemporal: [ { text: \"28 February 2025\", normalized: \"2025-02-28\", temporal_type: \"date\" } ]\n\nspatial: empty array.\n\nevent_type: [ { text: \"Influenza (seasonal)\", category: \"surveillance_update\", confidence: 0.8 } ]\n\nvenue_type: empty array.\n\ndisease: [ { text: \"influenza\", category: \"influenza\", disease_code: \"\" } ]\n\nWait, but the text says \"seasonal influenza\", so the text should be \"seasonal influenza\". But the category is \"influenza\" as per the allowed categories. The allowed categories include \"influenza\", so that's correct.\n\nSo the final JSON should have these entries.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"28 February 2025\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2025-02-28\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Influenza (seasonal)\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.8\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"seasonal influenza\",\n      \"category\": \"influenza\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

It is common in all parts of the world. Most people recover without treatment.\n\nInfluenza spreads easily between people when they cough or sneeze. Vaccination is the best way to prevent the disease.\n\nSymptoms of influenza include acute onset of fever, cough, sore throat, body aches and fatigue.\n\nTreatment should aim to relieve symptoms. People with the flu should rest and drink plenty of liquids. Most people will recover on their own within a week. Medical care may be needed in severe cases and for people with risk factors.\n\nThere are 4 types of influenza viruses, types A, B, C and D. Influenza A and B viruses circulate and cause seasonal epidemics of disease.\n\nInfluenza A viruses are further classified into subtypes according to the combinations of the proteins on the surface of the virus. Currently circulating in humans are subtype A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) influenza viruses. The A(H1N1) is also written as A(H1N1)pdm09 as it caused the pandemic in 2009 and replaced the previous A(H1N1) virus which had circulated prior to 2009. Only influenza type A viruses are known to have caused pandemics.\n\nInfluenza B viruses are not classified into subtypes but can be broken down into lineages. Influenza type B viruses belong to either B/Yamagata or B/Victoria lineage.",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a text about influenza and wants me to extract specific information into JSON. First, I need to parse the text and identify all the temporal, spatial, event types, venue types, and diseases mentioned.\n\nStarting with the temporal extraction. The text mentions \"usually last around a week.\" That's a duration. So I should normalize that to \"P7D\" since a week is 7 days. Then there's \"Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 as it caused the pandemic in 2009.\" The year 2009 is a date, so normalized as \"2009-01-01\" since the exact date isn't specified. Also, \"seasonal epidemics\" might imply a time frame, but the text doesn't specify a particular date, so maybe just the 2009 date is the main temporal here.\n\nNext, spatial. The text doesn't mention any specific locations like cities or countries. It talks about viruses and their classifications, so maybe no spatial data. But wait, the user's previous example had Broome, Western Australia. However, in this text, there's no location mentioned. So spatial array might be empty.\n\nEvent type: The text discusses influenza, its spread, symptoms, treatment, and vaccination. The main event here is the spread of influenza, which could be categorized as a surveillance update since it's providing information about the disease. But the allowed categories include surveillance_update. Alternatively, since it's about the disease itself, maybe \"other\" if none fit better. Wait, the event_type categories are exposure_site, case_report, outbreak_alert, etc. The text is more of an informational piece, so maybe \"surveillance_update\" is the best fit here with confidence 0.8.\n\nVenue type: The text doesn't mention any specific venues like hospitals or clinics. It's about the disease and its characteristics, so venue_type array might be empty.\n\nDisease: The text clearly mentions influenza, so the category is \"influenza\". The disease_code could be ICD-10 code J09, but the user didn't specify codes, so maybe leave it as empty or use \"J09\" if I know it. However, the schema requires disease_code, so I should include it. Let me check: Influenza's ICD-10 code is J09, but the exact code might vary. Alternatively, since the user's example used \"measles\" with code \"B05\", but the schema allows \"other\" if not specified. Wait, the disease category is \"influenza\" and the code is required. Maybe use \"J09\" as the code. But if unsure, perhaps leave it as empty. However, the schema requires it, so I need to include something. Let me check standard codes. Influenza is J09, but maybe the user expects a different code. Alternatively, since the text doesn't specify, maybe use \"other\" for the category and leave code empty? Wait, no, the category is \"influenza\" and the code is required. Hmm. Maybe the code is not provided, so perhaps leave it as an empty string. But the schema requires it. Maybe the user expects the code to be filled. Let me think. The example in the previous response had \"measles\" with code \"B05\". So for influenza, the code would be J09. So I'll include that.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have temporal entries for the duration and the 2009 date, event_type as surveillance_update, disease as influenza with code J09. Spatial and venue_type are empty arrays.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"usually last around a week\",\n      \"normalized\": \"P7D\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"duration\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"caused the pandemic in 2009\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2009-01-01\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Influenza A and B viruses circulate and cause seasonal epidemics of disease\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.8\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"influenza\",\n      \"category\": \"influenza\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"J09\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

They want me to extract specific information into JSON based on the given schema.\n\nFirst, looking at the temporal extraction. The text mentions \"Symptoms of influenza usually begin around 2 days after being infected.\" The phrase \"around 2 days\" is a duration. So I need to normalize that. The duration should be in ISO format, which would be P2D. But wait, the user's previous example had \"usually last around a week\" normalized to P7D. So following that, \"2 days\" becomes P2D. However, the text doesn't have a specific date or time, so the temporal_type is duration. The text here is \"around 2 days after being infected,\" so the normalized is P2D.\n\nNext, spatial. The text doesn't mention any specific locations like cities or countries. It's all about influenza types and symptoms. So spatial array should be empty.\n\nEvent_type: The text is informative about influenza, discussing types, symptoms, and risks. There's no mention of an event like an outbreak, case report, or exposure site. So event_type might be \"surveillance_update\" since it's providing information about the disease. But the user's previous example had \"exposure_site\" when there was a mention of a location. Here, since there's no event, maybe \"other\" with confidence 0.5? Wait, the schema requires category to be one of the listed options. Since the text is a general overview, maybe \"surveillance_update\" is the closest. But the original text doesn't mention any specific event. Hmm, maybe \"other\" with confidence 0.5. But the user's previous example had \"exposure_site\" even when the text was about a cyclone hitting a place. Wait, in the first example, the user's input was about a cyclone hitting Broome, and the event_type was \"exposure_site\" with a confidence of 1.0. But in this case, the text is about influenza types and symptoms, not an event. So maybe there's no event_type here. But the schema requires the array to have at least one item. Wait, the required array is empty in the schema. So maybe event_type can be empty. But the user's previous example had event_type even when there was no explicit event. Wait, in the first example, the user's input was about a cyclone hitting Broome, and the event_type was \"exposure_site\" with a confidence of 1.0. But in this case, the text is about influenza, not an event. So perhaps event_type is not applicable here. But the schema allows for \"other\" as a category. So maybe I should put \"surveillance_update\" as the category, but the text doesn't mention surveillance. Alternatively, maybe there's no event_type here. But the schema doesn't require it. So perhaps the event_type array is empty.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention any venues like hospitals, clinics, etc. So venue_type array is empty.\n\nDisease: The text talks about Influenza type B, Influenza C, Influenza D. The category should be \"influenza\". The text mentions \"Influenza type B\", \"Influenza C\", \"Influenza D\". So each of these should be extracted. But the schema requires the disease array to have objects with text, category, and disease_code. The category is \"influenza\" for all. The disease_code is not provided, so maybe leave it as empty or use a code. But the user's previous example had \"measles\" with category \"measles\" and disease_code as empty. So for each mention of influenza, I can have an entry. However, the text mentions \"Influenza type B\", \"Influenza C\", \"Influenza D\" as different types. But the category is \"influenza\" in the schema. So each of these would be under the same category. But the user's example had \"measles\" as a separate category. So perhaps each mention of a type is a separate entry. Wait, the schema's disease category includes \"influenza\" as an option. So for each mention of influenza types, the category is \"influenza\". So the text mentions \"Influenza type B\", \"Influenza C\", \"Influenza D\", and \"Influenza\". So each of these would be entries in the disease array. But the user's example had \"measles\" as a single entry. So maybe each occurrence of the disease name is an entry. However, the text is about different types, but the category is \"influenza\". So the disease array would have entries for each type mentioned. But the schema's disease category is \"influenza\" as a single option. So perhaps all mentions of influenza types are under the \"influenza\" category. So the text mentions \"Influenza type B\", \"Influenza C\", \"Influenza D\", and \"Influenza\". So each of these would be entries in the disease array with category \"influenza\". But the user's example had \"measles\" as a single entry. So maybe the disease array would have multiple entries for each mention. However, the user's example had \"measles\" once. So perhaps in this case, the disease array would have entries for each type mentioned. But the schema allows for multiple entries. So for \"Influenza type B\", \"Influenza C\", \"Influenza D\", and \"Influenza\", each would be a separate entry. But the text says \"Influenza type B viruses belong to either B/Yamagata or B/Victoria lineage.\" So \"Influenza type B\" is mentioned. Then \"Influenza C virus\" and \"Influenza D viruses\". So three entries. But the category is \"influenza\" for all. So the disease array would have three entries with text as \"Influenza type B\", \"Influenza C virus\", \"Influenza D viruses\", and category \"influenza\". But the user's example had \"measles\" once. So maybe the disease array would have entries for each type. However, the schema's disease category includes \"influenza\" as an option, so all these are under that category. So the disease array would have three entries. But the user's example had one entry for measles. So perhaps the answer should have three entries for each type. But the user's example had one entry. So maybe the answer should have three entries. However, the user's example had \"measles\" once. So perhaps the answer should have three entries for each type mentioned. But the schema allows for multiple entries.

Vaccination can protect health workers and the people around them.\n\nEpidemics can result in high levels of worker/school absenteeism and productivity losses.

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a text about influenza epidemiology and wants me to extract specific information into JSON. First, I need to parse the text carefully.\n\nLooking at the temporal extraction, the text mentions \"seasonal influenza epidemics\" but doesn't have specific dates. The previous context had a date, but since this text doesn't mention any, I should check if there's any implicit time. The user's previous example had a date, but here, there's no explicit temporal expression. So the temporal array might be empty.\n\nFor spatial, the text talks about \"crowded areas including schools and nursing homes.\" Schools and nursing homes are locations. Schools are typically cities or regions, but without specific names, I'll note them as 'school' and 'nursing home' with parent regions as 'other' since they aren't specific. Wait, the schema requires location_type and parent_region. Since the text doesn't mention specific cities or countries, maybe the parent_region is left blank or 'other'? But the schema requires parent_region. Hmm, maybe I should list them as 'feature' with parent_region as 'other' or leave it as empty. Wait, the required fields are text and location_type. Parent_region is optional. So for \"schools\" and \"nursing homes,\" I can list them as location_type 'feature' and parent_region as 'other' or just omit it. But the user's previous example included parent_region. Maybe in this case, since there's no specific region mentioned, I can leave parent_region as empty or 'other'. Let me check the schema again. The parent_region is a string, but not required. So maybe just include text and location_type.\n\nFor event_type, the text discusses risk groups, transmission, and epidemics. The categories include risk_warning, surveillance_update, or other. The mention of high-risk groups and transmission could fall under 'risk_warning' or 'surveillance_update'. The text doesn't mention an event like an outbreak or case report, so maybe 'risk_warning' with confidence 0.8.\n\nVenue_type: The text mentions schools and nursing homes. Schools are 'school' category, and nursing homes might be 'aged_care' since they're for elderly. So two entries here.\n\nDisease: The text clearly mentions influenza, so category 'influenza' with code 'J09' (ICD-10 for influenza). The text also refers to lower respiratory tract infections, but the main disease is influenza. So one entry for influenza.\n\nPutting it all together, I need to make sure each array is correctly filled. Temporal is empty, spatial has schools and nursing homes, event_type as risk_warning, venue_type as school and aged_care, disease as influenza. Check the confidence scores and ensure they are within 0.0-1.0. Also, ensure all required fields are present. Let me structure the JSON accordingly.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"schools\",\n      \"location_type\": \"feature\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"other\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"nursing homes\",\n      \"location_type\": \"feature\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"other\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Epidemics can result in high levels of worker/school absenteeism...\",\n      \"category\": \"risk_warning\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.8\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"schools\",\n      \"category\": \"school\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"school\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"nursing homes\",\n      \"category\": \"aged_care\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"nursing home\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"influenza\",\n      \"category\": \"influenza\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"J09\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

When an infected person coughs or sneezes, droplets containing viruses (infectious droplets) are dispersed into the air and can infect persons in close proximity. The virus can also be spread by hands contaminated with influenza viruses. To prevent transmission, people should cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing and wash their hands regularly.\n\nIn temperate climates, seasonal epidemics occur mainly during winter, while in tropical regions, influenza may occur throughout the year, causing outbreaks more irregularly.\n\nThe time from infection to illness, known as the incubation period, is about 2 days, but ranges from 1\u20134 days.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nMost cases of human influenza are clinically diagnosed. However, during periods of low influenza activity or outside of epidemics situations, the infection of other respiratory viruses (e.g. SARS-CoV-2, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza and adenovirus) can also present as influenza-like illness (ILI), which makes the clinical differentiation of influenza from other pathogens difficult.\n\nCollection of appropriate respiratory samples and the application of a laboratory diagnostic test is required to establish a definitive diagnosis.",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a text about seasonal influenza and wants me to extract specific information into JSON. First, I need to parse the text and identify all the temporal, spatial, event types, venue types, and diseases mentioned.\n\nStarting with the temporal expressions. The text mentions \"seasonal epidemics occur mainly during winter\" and \"in tropical regions, influenza may occur throughout the year.\" The word \"winter\" here is a season, which is a temporal type. But the user's previous example normalized dates, so maybe I need to convert seasons into a date range. However, the instructions say to normalize to ISO 8601. Since seasons aren't specific dates, perhaps I should note the temporal_type as \"interval\" and use a range like \"2023-06-21/2023-09-20\" for summer, but the text doesn't specify a year. Wait, the user's previous example used \"2022-03-15\" for a specific date. But here, the text doesn't have specific dates. The user's rules mention that for dates without years, use the most recent year in the document context. However, the document context here is unknown. The user's previous example had a publication date of unknown, but the current position was chunk 6 of 10. Maybe I should default to the current year if not specified. But the text doesn't mention any specific dates, just seasons. So maybe there are no temporal expressions here. Wait, the text says \"incubation period is about 2 days, but ranges from 1\u20134 days.\" That's a duration. So \"1\u20134 days\" would be a duration. The temporal_type should be \"duration\" and normalized as \"P1D\" to \"P4D\" but the exact range is 1-4 days. However, the user's example normalized durations like \"P7D\" for a week. So maybe I should represent the range as \"P1D/P4D\" but the schema might not allow that. Wait, the schema for temporal_type has \"duration\" as an option, and normalized should be in ISO 8601. For durations, it's P followed by the time. But the text says \"ranges from 1\u20134 days,\" so perhaps the duration is P1D to P4D. However, the JSON schema expects a single normalized value. Maybe I should take the maximum or represent it as a range. But the user's example had \"usually last around a week \u2192 P7D\". So maybe for the incubation period, the normalized duration is \"P2D\" as the average, but the text says it ranges from 1-4 days. Hmm, the user's instruction says to normalize to ISO 8601. For durations, it's P followed by the time. So perhaps the duration is \"P1D\" to \"P4D\", but the schema might require a single value. Maybe the user expects the average, which is 2 days, so \"P2D\". But the text says \"ranges from 1\u20134 days,\" so maybe the duration is \"P1D/P4D\". However, the schema for normalized is a string, so perhaps I can write \"P1D/P4D\". But I need to check the example. In the previous example, the user had \"usually last around a week \u2192 P7D\". So maybe for ranges, we take the average or the most common. Alternatively, maybe the user expects to list both. But the schema might not allow that. Alternatively, maybe the duration is \"P1D\" to \"P4D\" as a range. But the JSON schema for normalized is a string, so perhaps I can write \"P1D-P4D\". However, the user's example used \"P7D\" for a week. So perhaps the correct approach is to take the average, which is 2 days, so \"P2D\". But the text says \"ranges from 1\u20134 days,\" so maybe the duration is \"P1D\" to \"P4D\". But the schema might not support that. Alternatively, maybe the user expects to list both. However, the user's previous example had a single normalized value. So perhaps I should take the average. But the user's instruction says to normalize to ISO 8601. For durations, it's P followed by the time. So \"P1D\" to \"P4D\" would be two durations. But the text mentions a range, so maybe the normalized should be \"P1D/P4D\". However, the schema might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the user expects to list both as separate entries. But the user's example had a single entry. Hmm. Maybe the correct approach is to take the average, which is 2 days, so \"P2D\". But the text says \"ranges from 1\u20134 days,\" so perhaps the duration is \"P1D\" to \"P4D\". But I'm not sure. Let me check the user's previous example. In the first example, the user had \"usually last around a week \u2192 P7D\". So for a range, they took the average. So maybe here, the incubation period is 2 days on average, so \"P2D\". So I'll go with that.\n\nNext, spatial. The text doesn't mention any specific locations. It talks about schools and nursing homes as crowded areas, but those are general terms. The user's previous example had a specific location like \"Broome, Western Australia\". Here, the text doesn't have specific locations, so maybe the spatial array is empty.\n\nEvent_type: The text discusses transmission, diagnosis, and general information about influenza. There's no specific event like an outbreak alert or case report. The user's previous example had \"exposure site\" and \"case report\" categories. Here, the text is more about general information, so maybe no event_type. But the user's schema requires event_type to be an array. If there's no event, maybe it's empty.\n\nVenue_type: The text mentions schools and nursing homes. Schools are a venue_type category. Nursing homes are part of aged_care. So for \"schools\" and \"nursing homes\", the venue_type would be \"school\" and \"aged_care\" respectively. But the user's schema requires the venue_name. However, the text doesn't specify specific names, just general terms. So maybe the venue_type entries would have text as \"schools\" and \"nursing homes\", category as \"school\" and \"aged_care\", and venue_name as empty? But the schema requires venue_name. Wait, looking at the schema for venue_type, the required fields are text, category, and venue_name. So even if the venue_name is not specified, it's required. But the text doesn't mention specific names. So perhaps the venue_name is empty. But the user's previous example had \"Margaret River Emergency Department\" as the venue_name. So maybe in this case, since the text doesn't mention specific venues, the venue_type array is empty. Or maybe the text mentions \"schools\" and \"nursing homes\" as venues. So for example, \"schools\" would be category \"school\" and venue_name as \"school\" (but that's not a specific name). Hmm, this is tricky. The user's schema requires venue_name, which is a specific name. Since the text doesn't mention specific names, maybe the venue_type array is empty.\n\nDisease: The text mentions \"seasonal influenza\" and \"influenza-like illness (ILI)\". The allowed categories include \"influenza\". So the disease category would be \"influenza\" with text \"influenza\" and disease_code as \"J09\" (ICD-10 code for influenza). But the user's previous example had \"measles\" with category \"measles\" and disease_code as \"B05\". So here, the disease is \"influenza\", category \"influenza\", and disease_code \"J09\".\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nTemporal: The incubation period is 1-4 days, normalized as \"P2D\" (average). So the temporal array has one entry with text \"The time from infection to illness, known as the incubation period, is about 2 days, but ranges from 1\u20134 days.\" normalized \"P2D\", temporal_type \"duration\".\n\nSpatial: No specific locations, so empty array.\n\nEvent_type: No specific events, so empty array.\n\nVenue_type: The text mentions schools and nursing homes. So two entries. For \"schools\", category \"school\", venue_name \"school\". For \"nursing homes\", category \"aged_care\", venue_name \"nursing home\". But the schema requires venue_name, so even if it's a general term, it's filled in.\n\nDisease: One entry for \"influenza\", category \"influenza\", disease_code \"J09\".\n\nWait, but the user's previous example had \"measles\" with category \"measles\" and disease_code \"B05\". So for influenza, the code is J09. So that's correct.\n\nSo the final JSON would have temporal with the duration, venue_type with school and aged_care, disease with influenza, and others empty.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"The time from infection to illness, known as the incubation period, is about 2 days, but ranges from 1\u20134 days\",\n      \"normalized\": \"P2D\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"duration\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [],\n  \"venue_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"schools\",\n      \"category\": \"school\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"school\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"nursing homes\",\n      \"category\": \"aged_care\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"nursing home\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"influenza\",\n      \"category\": \"influenza\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"J09\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a text about influenza diagnosis and treatment, and they want me to extract specific information into JSON based on the schema they provided. \n\nFirst, I need to check for temporal expressions. The text mentions \"Most people will recover from influenza on their own.\" There's no specific date, time, or duration mentioned here. The previous context had some temporal references, but this text doesn't include any. So the temporal array might be empty.\n\nNext, spatial mentions. The text doesn't talk about locations, cities, or regions. It's all about medical procedures and treatment. So the spatial array should also be empty.\n\nFor event_type, the text discusses diagnostic methods and treatment guidelines. The categories allowed include things like case_report or surveillance_update. Since this is about laboratory techniques and treatment guidelines, maybe \"surveillance_update\" fits here. But I'm not sure. The text doesn't mention an event like an outbreak or a specific case report, so maybe \"other\" is safer. But the user's example had \"exposure_site\" even though it wasn't directly mentioned. Wait, the example might not be directly applicable here. Let me check again. The text is about diagnostic methods, so perhaps no specific event type. Maybe \"other\" with confidence 0.5?\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention any specific venues like hospitals or clinics. So this array would be empty.\n\nDisease: The text clearly mentions \"influenza\" multiple times. The category should be \"influenza\" with the disease_code. The ICD-10 code for influenza is J09-J11, but the user might expect a specific code. However, the example in the previous response used \"measles\" with category and code. Since the text doesn't specify a code, maybe leave disease_code as empty or use a placeholder. But the schema requires it. Hmm, maybe use \"J09\" as a common code for influenza. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, leave it as empty. Wait, the required fields include disease_code, so I have to include it. Maybe use \"J09\" as the code for influenza.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would have empty arrays for temporal, spatial, venue_type, and event_type. For disease, one entry with influenza and code J09. But I need to check if the event_type is applicable. The text is more about guidelines, so maybe \"surveillance_update\" or \"other\". Since the user's example had \"exposure_site\" even when not directly mentioned, maybe \"other\" with confidence 0.5. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's no event_type here. The schema allows for empty arrays, so perhaps event_type is empty. Wait, the required fields in the schema are empty, so the properties can be empty. So maybe all arrays are empty except disease. Let me confirm.\n\nThe text doesn't mention any specific event, so event_type is empty. Similarly, no venues, no spatial info. The disease is influenza, so that's the only entry. The disease_code could be \"J09\" as a common code for influenza. So the final JSON would have the disease array with that entry.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"influenza\",\n      \"category\": \"influenza\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"J09\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a block of text about influenza prevention and vaccines. They want me to extract specific information into JSON based on the given schema.\n\nFirst, I need to check for temporal expressions. The text mentions \"more than 60 years\" regarding vaccines. Since there's no specific date, I should normalize that as a duration. \"More than 60 years\" would be P60Y. But wait, the schema's temporal_type includes duration, so that's valid.\n\nNext, spatial mentions. The text doesn't have any specific locations like cities or countries. The WHO is mentioned, but the parent region isn't specified here. So maybe no spatial entries.\n\nFor event_type, the text talks about surveillance and prevention. The WHO GISRS monitors resistance, which sounds like surveillance_update. The prevention methods might be risk_warning, but the main event here is the surveillance system. So I'll categorize that as surveillance_update with high confidence.\n\nVenue_type isn't mentioned here. The text doesn't talk about specific venues like hospitals or clinics, so this array might be empty.\n\nDisease is clearly influenza. The text mentions \"influenza\" multiple times, so the category is influenza. The disease_code could be J09 (ICD-10 for influenza), but since it's not specified, maybe leave it as empty or use 'other'? Wait, the schema requires disease_code, but the user didn't provide codes. The example in the previous response used 'other' for measles. Maybe here, since it's influenza, use the category 'influenza' and leave disease_code as empty? Wait, the required fields are text, category, disease_code. But the user's example had 'other' for disease_code. Wait, looking back, the user's example for measles had \"category\": \"measles\", \"confidence\": 1.0, and disease_code was not present. Wait, no, in the previous response, the disease entry had \"text\": \"measles\", \"category\": \"measles\", \"confidence\": 1.0. But the schema here requires disease_code. Wait, the schema for disease requires disease_code, but the user's example didn't include it. Hmm, maybe the user made a mistake, but I need to follow the schema. Since the text says \"influenza\", the category is influenza, and disease_code could be J09, but if unsure, maybe leave it as empty. Wait, the schema says \"required\": [\"text\", \"category\", \"disease_code\"], so I have to include disease_code. But the user's example didn't have it. Maybe the user intended to have it as optional? Wait, no, the required array includes disease_code. So I need to include it. But since the text doesn't provide a code, perhaps use \"other\" or leave it blank. But the schema requires it. Maybe the user expects it to be empty, but the schema says it's required. This is a bit confusing. Maybe the user made an error in the schema, but I have to follow it. So for disease_code, perhaps use \"J09\" as the ICD-10 code for influenza. Alternatively, if unsure, use \"other\". But the text doesn't mention a code, so maybe \"other\" is safer. Wait, the example in the previous response had \"measles\" with category \"measles\" and no disease_code. But according to the current schema, disease_code is required. So maybe the user intended to have it as optional, but the schema says required. This is conflicting. To comply with the schema, I'll include disease_code as \"J09\" for influenza. Alternatively, if not sure, use \"other\". But the user's example didn't have it, so maybe the schema is incorrect. But I have to follow the schema. So I'll proceed with \"J09\" as the code.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have temporal with P60Y, event_type as surveillance_update, disease as influenza with code J09. Spatial and venue_type are empty. Let me check again. The text mentions \"WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS)\" which is a surveillance system, so event_type is surveillance_update. The prevention methods are part of the surveillance update. The disease is influenza. The temporal is \"more than 60 years\" normalized to P60Y. So the JSON should have those entries.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"more than 60 years\",\n      \"normalized\": \"P60Y\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"duration\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"The WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) monitors resistance to antivirals\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"influenza\",\n      \"category\": \"influenza\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"J09\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a text about influenza vaccines and WHO's response. They want me to extract specific information into JSON based on the schema they provided.\n\nFirst, I need to look for temporal expressions. The text mentions \"seasonal influenza vaccine compositions twice a year for the northern and southern hemisphere influenza seasons.\" The key here is \"twice a year,\" which is a duration. But the schema requires ISO 8601 format. Since there's no specific date, maybe I should note that there's no explicit temporal expression. Wait, the user's previous example had a date, but here the text doesn't have a specific date. So maybe the temporal array is empty? Or is there a duration? The phrase \"twice a year\" could be a duration, but the schema's temporal_type includes duration. However, the example in the previous interaction had a date. But in this case, the text doesn't have a specific date or time. So perhaps the temporal array is empty.\n\nNext, spatial mentions. The text doesn't mention any specific locations like cities or countries. The WHO is mentioned, but it's an organization, not a location. So spatial array might be empty.\n\nEvent type: The text talks about WHO's activities, like monitoring, recommending vaccines, guiding countries, etc. These are more about surveillance and response. The category \"surveillance_update\" might fit here. The text mentions \"continuously monitors influenza viruses and activity globally\" which could be a surveillance update. So event_type could have an entry with category \"surveillance_update\" and confidence 1.0.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention any specific venues like hospitals or clinics. So venue_type array is empty.\n\nDisease: The text mentions \"influenza\" multiple times. The category should be \"influenza\" and the disease_code might be ICD-10 code J09-J11, but since it's not specified, maybe leave it as empty or use \"other\"? Wait, the schema requires disease_code, but the user's example had \"measles\" with category and code. However, in this case, the text doesn't provide a code, so perhaps the disease_code is empty. But the schema requires it. Hmm, maybe the user expects the code to be omitted if not present. Wait, looking back at the schema, the required fields for disease are text, category, and disease_code. So I need to include disease_code even if it's empty? Or maybe the user allows it to be omitted. Wait, the schema says \"required\": [\"text\", \"category\", \"disease_code\"], so all three are required. But the text doesn't mention a code. So perhaps I should put an empty string for disease_code. But the user's previous example had \"measles\" with category and code. Maybe in this case, since the disease is influenza, the code would be J09-J11, but without specific info, maybe leave it as empty. Alternatively, maybe the user expects the code to be omitted, but the schema requires it. This is a bit tricky. Maybe the best approach is to include the category as \"influenza\" and leave disease_code as an empty string, but the schema requires it. Wait, the user's example had \"measles\" with category and code. So perhaps in this case, since the text doesn't mention a code, we can leave it as an empty string. But the schema requires it. So I'll have to include it, even if it's empty.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nTemporal: No specific dates, so empty array.\n\nSpatial: No locations, so empty array.\n\nEvent_type: One entry for surveillance_update with confidence 1.0.\n\nVenue_type: Empty array.\n\nDisease: One entry for influenza, category \"influenza\", disease_code empty string.\n\nWait, but the schema requires disease_code. So maybe the user expects it to be present. But since it's not mentioned, perhaps the code is not applicable. However, the schema requires it. Maybe the user allows empty strings. So I'll proceed with that.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"WHO continuously monitors influenza viruses and activity globally, recommends seasonal influenza vaccine compositions twice a year for the northern and southern hemisphere influenza seasons\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"influenza\",\n      \"category\": \"influenza\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a block of text and wants me to extract specific information into JSON based on the given schema. First, I need to parse the text carefully.\n\nLooking at the text, there are several parts. The first part mentions \"Recommendations announced for influenza vaccine composition for the 2026 southern hemisphere influenza season 26 September 2025\". Here, the date is \"26 September 2025\". According to the rules, I need to normalize this to ISO 8601, which would be \"2025-09-26\". The temporal type here is a date.\n\nNext, there's \"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) 9 August 2023\". The date here is \"9 August 2023\", normalized to \"2023-08-09\". Again, a date.\n\nThen \"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 25 March 2025\" becomes \"2025-03-25\".\n\nAnother date is \"30 September 2025\" from the Sri Lanka article. Normalized to \"2025-09-30\".\n\nNow, for spatial mentions. The text includes regions like \"Africa\", \"Americas\", \"Eastern Mediterranean\", \"Europe\", \"South-East Asia\", \"Western Pacific\". These are all regions, so location_type should be \"region\". Parent_region isn't specified, so maybe leave it blank or as \"global\"? Wait, the user's previous example had parent regions like \"Western Australia\". But these are continents or regions, so perhaps parent_region isn't needed here. But the schema requires \"parent_region\" as a property. Hmm, maybe just omit it or set to empty string? Wait, the required fields for spatial are \"text\" and \"location_type\". Parent_region is optional. So I can include it if possible. For example, \"Africa\" is a continent, so maybe parent_region is \"World\" or leave it. But the user's previous example had \"Western Australia\" as parent_region for Broome. So maybe for regions like \"Africa\", parent_region is not applicable. So perhaps leave parent_region as empty or not include it. Wait, the schema says \"parent_region\" is part of the properties but not required. So I can include it if possible. But since the text doesn't mention a parent region for these regions, maybe just omit it. Wait, the user's previous example included parent_region for Broome as \"Western Australia\". So for regions like \"Africa\", maybe the parent_region is \"World\" or \"Global\". But the user's example didn't have that. Maybe it's better to leave parent_region as empty or not include it. But the schema allows it. Let me check the schema again. The spatial properties require \"text\" and \"location_type\", and \"parent_region\" is optional. So I can include it if there's a parent, otherwise omit. Since the text doesn't mention a parent for these regions, maybe just include \"text\" and \"location_type\".\n\nFor event_type, the text mentions \"Recommendations announced for influenza vaccine composition\". This seems like a surveillance_update or a risk_warning? Or maybe \"surveillance_update\" since it's about vaccine recommendations. The category options include \"surveillance_update\". So I can assign that. Confidence is 1.0.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention any specific venues like hospitals or clinics. So venue_type array might be empty.\n\nDisease mentions: The text refers to \"influenza\", \"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)\", \"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)\", and \"Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infection\". So for each of these, the category would be \"influenza\", \"covid19\", \"other\" (since RSV isn't in the allowed categories), and \"other\" for hMPV. Wait, the allowed categories for disease include \"influenza\", \"covid19\", \"other\". So RSV and hMPV would be \"other\". The disease_code is optional, but the user's example had \"measles\" with category \"measles\" and no code. So for these, I can set category accordingly.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nTemporal entries: the four dates mentioned. Each normalized and type as date.\n\nSpatial entries: the regions listed, each as location_type \"region\".\n\nEvent_type: the vaccine recommendation as \"surveillance_update\".\n\nDisease: influenza, covid19, and others for RSV and hMPV.\n\nVenue_type: empty array since no venues mentioned.\n\nI need to make sure all required fields are present. For example, in disease, \"disease_code\" is required. But the user's example didn't include it. Wait, looking back at the schema, the disease properties require \"text\", \"category\", and \"disease_code\". But the user's previous example had \"measles\" with category \"measles\" and no disease_code. However, the schema says \"disease_code\" is required. Wait, no, looking at the schema again:\n\nIn the disease properties, \"required\": [\"text\", \"category\", \"disease_code\"]. So disease_code is required. But the user's previous example didn't include it. That's a problem. Wait, the user's previous example had:\n\n\"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles\",\n      \"category\": \"measles\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ]\n\nBut according to the schema, disease_code is required. So maybe the user made a mistake in the example. But the current task requires following the schema. So for disease_code, even if not present, it's required. But the user's input doesn't provide codes. So perhaps set disease_code to empty string or omit? Wait, the schema says \"required\": [\"text\", \"category\", \"disease_code\"], so all three are required. But the user's example didn't include disease_code. This is conflicting. However, the user's instruction says to return only valid JSON. So perhaps in this case, since the disease_code is not provided, we can leave it as an empty string. But the user's example didn't do that. Hmm. Maybe the user made a mistake in the schema. But I have to follow the schema as given. So for each disease entry, include \"disease_code\" even if it's empty.\n\nSo for \"influenza\", category is \"influenza\", disease_code could be \"J00-J06\" (ICD-10 code for influenza). But since the user's example didn't include codes, maybe just leave it as empty string. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that if the category is known, the code is optional. But according to the schema, it's required. So I'll have to include it, even if empty.\n\nBut the user's example didn't have it. Maybe the schema is incorrect. But I have to follow the schema. So for each disease entry, include \"disease_code\" as empty string.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON should have the temporal entries, spatial entries, event_type, and disease entries with their codes.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"26 September 2025\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2025-09-26\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"9 August 2023\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2023-08-09\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"25 March 2025\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2025-03-25\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"30 September 2025\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2025-09-30\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Africa\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Americas\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Eastern Mediterranean\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Europe\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"South-East Asia\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Western Pacific\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Recommendations announced for influenza vaccine composition for the 2026 southern hemisphere influenza season\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"influenza\",\n      \"category\": \"influenza\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)\",\n      \"category\": \"covid19\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infection\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The task is to extract specific fields: temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, and disease.\n\nFirst, looking at the input text: \"When autocomplete results are available use up and down arrows to review and enter to select.\" This seems like a UI instruction, not relevant to the extraction. Then there's \"Home\" and other navigation links, which are probably not part of the actual content. The rest includes topics, resources, diseases like Dengue, Endometriosis, etc., and regions. There's also news sections, disease outbreak news, and some specific diseases mentioned.\n\nBut the user's example had a sentence about a cyclone hitting Broome. In this case, the input doesn't have a specific event or disease mentioned. The content is more about navigation and listing topics, diseases, and regions. So, there's no explicit temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, or disease information to extract. \n\nThe previous example had a cyclone event, but here, the text doesn't mention any health events, diseases, or specific locations related to health. The only mentions are general topics and regions, which might not fit the required categories. For instance, \"Western Pacific\" is a region, but without a specific event or disease linked to it, it's not applicable. \n\nTherefore, the correct response is an empty JSON object since none of the required fields have relevant data. The user's example had a cyclone, but this input doesn't have any such information. So, all arrays will be empty.\n</think>\n\n{}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a block of text related to WHO's data hub and some statistics about vaccination coverage. The task is to extract specific information into JSON based on the given schema.\n\nFirst, looking at the temporal extraction. The text mentions \"15 July 2025\" and \"2024\" in several places. The date \"15 July 2025\" should be normalized to \"2025-07-15\" as a date. The year 2024 is mentioned multiple times, but since there's no specific date, maybe just the year as a date? Wait, the rules say for dates without years, use the most recent year in the document. The document context's current position is chunk 2 of 11, but the publication date is unknown. However, the text has \"15 July 2025\" which is a specific date, so that's a temporal expression. The 2024 mentions are years, so they should be normalized as \"2024\" as dates. But the schema requires temporal_type to be one of date, time, datetime, duration, interval. Since 2024 is a year, it's a date. So I'll include both \"2025-07-15\" and \"2024\" as dates.\n\nNext, spatial. The text doesn't mention specific locations like cities or countries. The only place names are \"WHO\" and \"Felix Marquez Community-wide vaccination\", but \"Felix Marquez\" might be a person's name, not a location. So maybe no spatial entries here. Wait, the user's previous example had Broome, Western Australia. But in this text, there's no location mentioned. So spatial array might be empty.\n\nEvent_type: The text talks about vaccination coverage, measles, and HPV vaccine. The phrase \"Community-wide vaccination is the most effective way to prevent measles\" suggests a vaccination clinic or a surveillance update? The categories include vaccination_clinic, but the text isn't about a specific event. Maybe \"surveillance_update\" since it's about coverage data. But the user's previous example had \"exposure_site\" for a cyclone. Hmm. Alternatively, since it's about vaccination, maybe \"vaccination_clinic\" isn't right. The event_type categories include \"surveillance_update\" which might fit here. But the text isn't an event report, just data. Maybe \"other\"? Or perhaps there's no event_type here. Need to check the schema again. The event_type is for health events like exposure sites, case reports, etc. Since the text is about vaccination coverage stats, maybe no event_type. But the user's previous example had \"exposure_site\" even though it was a cyclone. Wait, maybe the user's example was a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the vaccination is part of a vaccination clinic. But the text doesn't mention a specific venue. So perhaps event_type is empty.\n\nVenue_type: The text mentions \"Felix Marquez Community-wide vaccination\". \"Community-wide\" might imply a community venue. The category \"community\" is in the venue_type enum. So maybe a venue_type entry with category \"community\" and venue_name \"Felix Marquez Community-wide vaccination\". But the text doesn't specify a venue name, just the community-wide aspect. Alternatively, maybe no venue_type here.\n\nDisease: The text mentions measles and HPV vaccine. Measles is a category, so that's one entry. HPV is not in the allowed categories, so it's \"other\". Wait, the disease categories include \"other\". So for HPV, category is \"other\". But the text also mentions diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (DTP3) and measles. So measles is a category, and DTP3 is part of the vaccine, but the disease category is measles. So the disease entries would be measles and other for HPV.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nTemporal: two dates, 2025-07-15 and 2024.\n\nSpatial: none.\n\nEvent_type: maybe \"surveillance_update\" with confidence 0.8? Or maybe none. The text is about data, not an event. So perhaps event_type is empty.\n\nVenue_type: maybe \"community\" with venue_name \"Felix Marquez Community-wide vaccination\".\n\nDisease: measles and other (for HPV).\n\nWait, the user's previous example had \"measles\" as a category. So in this case, the text mentions measles and HPV. So for disease, two entries: measles and other (for HPV). But the schema requires disease_code, which is ICD-10 or SNOMED. Measles is B05, but maybe the user expects just the category. The schema says disease_code is optional? Wait, looking back, the required fields for disease are text, category, disease_code. Wait, no, the required fields are text, category, disease_code. Wait, the schema says:\n\n\"disease\": {\n  \"type\": \"array\",\n  \"items\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"text\": { ... },\n      \"category\": { ... },\n      \"disease_code\": { ... }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"text\", \"category\", \"disease_code\"]\n  }\n}\n\nSo disease_code is required. But the user's example didn't include disease_code. Hmm, but the user's previous response had \"disease_code\": \"B05\" for measles. So in this case, for measles, the code is B05. For HPV, the category is \"other\", and the disease_code would be something like \"N82\" (for HPV), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if it's not in the allowed categories, maybe leave it as \"other\" and disease_code as empty? But the schema requires disease_code. So perhaps for HPV, category is \"other\" and disease_code is \"N82\" (assuming that's the ICD-10 code for HPV). But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the user expects the code to be omitted, but the schema requires it. This is a bit tricky. Maybe the user expects the code to be present even if it's not in the allowed categories. So for measles, code B05, and for HPV, code N82. But the user's previous example didn't include disease_code, so maybe it's optional. Wait, looking back at the schema, the required fields for disease are text, category, disease_code. So disease_code is required. Therefore, even if it's \"other\", we need to provide a code. But the user's previous example had \"disease_code\": \"B05\" for measles. So in this case, for measles, code B05. For HPV, since it's not in the allowed categories, category is \"other\", and disease_code could be \"N82\" (assuming that's the code for HPV). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the user expects the code to be omitted, but the schema requires it. This is a bit of a problem. Maybe the user made a mistake in the schema, but I have to follow it. So I'll proceed with the codes.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nTemporal entries: \"15 July 2025\" becomes \"2025-07-15\" as a date. The 2024 mentions are years, so normalized as \"2024\" as dates.\n\nSpatial: none.\n\nEvent_type: The text is about vaccination coverage, which might be a surveillance update. So category \"surveillance_update\" with confidence 0.8.\n\nVenue_type: \"Felix Marquez Community-wide vaccination\" as a community venue. Category \"community\", venue_name \"Felix Marquez Community-wide vaccination\".\n\nDisease: measles (category measles, code B05) and HPV (category other, code N82).\n\nBut the user's previous example had \"measles\" as a category and \"disease_code\": \"B05\". So I'll follow that.\n\nSo the JSON would have:\n\ntemporal: two entries, 2025-07-15 and 2024.\n\nspatial: empty.\n\nevent_type: one entry, \"surveillance_update\" with confidence 0.8.\n\nvenue_type: one entry, category community, venue_name \"Felix Marquez Community-wide vaccination\".\n\ndisease: two entries, measles and other (HPV).\n\nBut need to check if the text mentions \"measles\" and \"HPV\". The text says \"prevent measles\" and \"first dose of measles vaccine\" and \"HPV vaccine\". So measles is a category, and HPV is other.\n\nSo the final JSON would include these elements.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"15 July 2025\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2025-07-15\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"2024\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2024\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Community-wide vaccination is the most effective way to prevent measles\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.8\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Felix Marquez Community-wide vaccination\",\n      \"category\": \"community\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"Felix Marquez Community-wide vaccination\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles\",\n      \"category\": \"measles\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"B05\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"HPV vaccine\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"N82\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

However, these global figures hide significant disparity among countries of different income strata, with low-income countries lagging behind.\n\nMeasles, because of its high transmissibility, acts as an early warning system, quickly exposing immunity gaps in the population. Still, 20.6 million children missed their routine first dose of measles, far from the 2019 level of 19.3 million.\n\nGlobal immunization coverage 2024\n\nA summary of global vaccination coverage in 2024 follows.\n\nHaemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) causes meningitis and pneumonia.

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a text about global vaccination coverage in 2024 and wants the JSON extraction based on the specified schema. First, I need to parse the text and extract the required fields: temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, and disease.\n\nStarting with temporal expressions. The text mentions \"2024\" and \"2019 level\". According to the rules, relative dates should use the most recent occurrence. The document context's current position is Chunk 3 of 11, but the user hasn't provided previous chunks. However, the previous temporal references include 15 July 2025 and 2024. Since the text here is about 2024, I'll normalize that as 2024. The \"2019 level\" would be normalized to 2019-01-01 since there's no specific date. Also, \"2023\" is mentioned, so that becomes 2023-01-01. \n\nNext, spatial mentions. The text refers to \"countries at risk of it\" (yellow fever) and \"low-income countries\". \"Countries at risk\" is a general term, so I'll categorize as \"country\" without a parent region. \"Low-income countries\" is also a region, but since it's a socioeconomic group, maybe \"region\" with parent_region as \"global\" or leave it as \"other\". But the schema allows \"country\" and \"region\". Maybe \"region\" with parent_region as \"global\" isn't specified, so perhaps just \"country\" without parent_region. Wait, the example in the previous response had \"Western Australia\" as parent_region. Here, \"countries at risk\" is a general term, so maybe no parent region. Similarly, \"low-income countries\" is a region type, but the parent_region might be \"global\" or not specified. The schema allows \"other\" for location_type. Hmm, need to check the allowed enums. The spatial location_type includes country, city, region, etc. So \"countries at risk\" could be \"region\" with parent_region as \"global\" or \"other\". But since the text doesn't specify a particular country, maybe just \"country\" without parent_region. Alternatively, \"region\" with parent_region as \"global\". But the user's example had \"Western Australia\" as parent_region. Maybe for \"countries at risk\", it's better to list as \"country\" without parent_region. Also, \"low-income countries\" is a region, so location_type: \"region\", parent_region: \"global\" or \"other\". But the schema doesn't have \"global\" as a parent_region, so maybe leave it as \"other\". Alternatively, since it's a socioeconomic group, maybe \"other\". \n\nFor event_type, the text talks about vaccination coverage, which is a surveillance update. The categories include \"surveillance_update\". The text mentions coverage data, so that fits. The confidence is 1.0. \n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention specific venues like hospitals or clinics. It's about global coverage, so venue_type might not apply here. But the schema requires it. Wait, the user's example had venue_type even when not present. Wait, looking back, the user's previous response included venue_type even when the text didn't mention a venue. Wait, no, in the previous example, the user's input had \"Margaret River Emergency Department\" which was a venue. In this case, the text doesn't mention any specific venue, so venue_type might be empty. But the schema requires it? No, the required array is empty. Wait, the schema for venue_type is an array, but the required array is empty. So it's okay to have an empty array. \n\nDisease: The text mentions measles, Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b), DTP3 (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis), yellow fever, and HPV. The allowed categories are measles, influenza, covid19, pertussis, meningococcal, hepatitis, gastroenteritis, dengue, ross_river_virus, other. So measles is covered. Hib is not in the list, so category \"other\". DTP3 is a vaccine, not a disease. Yellow fever is a disease, but it's not in the allowed list. Wait, the allowed categories for disease include \"other\". So for Hib, it's \"other\". For yellow fever, also \"other\". For DTP3, it's a vaccine, so not a disease. So the diseases mentioned are measles, Hib (other), yellow fever (other), and maybe others. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nTemporal: 2024, 2019, 2023. Normalized as 2024, 2019-01-01, 2023-01-01. Temporal_type: date.\n\nSpatial: \"countries at risk\" as country, \"low-income countries\" as region with parent_region \"global\" or \"other\". But since the text doesn't specify, maybe just \"country\" for \"countries at risk\" and \"region\" for \"low-income countries\" with parent_region as \"global\" (though not sure). Alternatively, since the text doesn't specify a particular location, maybe spatial is empty. Wait, the user's example had spatial entries even when the text didn't mention specific locations. Wait, in the previous example, the user's input had \"Broome, Western Australia\" which was spatial. In this case, the text mentions \"countries at risk\" and \"low-income countries\", which are general terms. So spatial entries would be:\n\n- text: \"countries at risk of it\", location_type: \"country\", parent_region: (maybe not applicable, so leave empty)\n- text: \"low-income countries\", location_type: \"region\", parent_region: \"global\" (but not sure if that's allowed). Alternatively, since the parent_region is for disambiguation, maybe leave it as \"other\".\n\nBut the schema allows \"country\" and \"region\" as location_type. So for \"countries at risk\", location_type: \"country\", parent_region: (not specified, so maybe omit). For \"low-income countries\", location_type: \"region\", parent_region: \"global\" (but the parent_region is for disambiguation, like state or country. Since \"low-income countries\" is a group, maybe parent_region is \"global\" or \"other\". \n\nBut the user's example had \"Western Australia\" as parent_region. So perhaps for \"countries at risk\", it's better to list as \"country\" without parent_region. Similarly, \"low-income countries\" as \"region\" with parent_region \"global\" or \"other\". \n\nEvent_type: \"surveillance_update\" with confidence 1.0.\n\nVenue_type: empty array since no specific venue mentioned.\n\nDisease: measles (category measles), Hib (other), yellow fever (other), DTP3 (not a disease, so not included), HPV (not in allowed categories, so other). Wait, the allowed categories for disease include \"other\". So for Hib, it's \"other\", yellow fever is \"other\", and HPV is \"other\". \n\nSo compiling all this into the JSON structure as per the schema.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"2024\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2024\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"2019 level\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2019-01-01\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"2023\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2023\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"countries at risk of it\",\n      \"location_type\": \"country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"low-income countries\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"data highlight a troubling trajectory in progress toward key targets of the global Immunization Agenda 2030 (IA2030)\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles\",\n      \"category\": \"measles\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Haemophilus influenzae type b\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"yellow fever\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Hepatitis B vaccine for infants had been introduced nationwide in 190 Member States by the end of 2024. Global coverage with 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine is estimated at 84%. In addition, 117 Member States introduced 1 dose of hepatitis B vaccine to newborns within the first 24 hours of life. Global coverage is 45% and is as high as 79% in the WHO Western Pacific Region, while it is estimated at only 17% in the WHO African Region.\n\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common viral infection affecting the reproductive tract and can cause cervical cancer in women, other types of cancer, and genital warts in both men and women. The HPV vaccine was provided in national immunization programmes and services in 147 countries in 2024, including new introductions in four countries. In 2024, 67 countries \u2013 representing more than 80% of girls aged 9\u201314 years old vaccinated in that year \u2013 used a 1-dose schedule. Global coverage with the first dose of HPV among girls is now estimated at 31%. While far from the 90% target by 2030, it represents a large increase from the 17% coverage in 2019.",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a text about vaccination coverage for Hib, Hepatitis B, and HPV. They want me to extract temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, and disease information in JSON format.\n\nFirst, looking at the temporal part. The text mentions \"by the end of 2024\" and \"in 2024\". The end of 2024 would be 2024-12-31, but since the exact date isn't specified, maybe just the year. But the schema requires ISO format. The user's previous example normalized \"March 15, 2022\" to \"2022-03-15\". So for \"by the end of 2024\", maybe \"2024-12-31\"? But the user's previous example used the exact date. However, the text here says \"by the end of 2024\" for Hib, so maybe the temporal_type is \"date\" with the end date. Similarly, \"in 2024\" would be the same. Also, there's a mention of 2019 in the HPV part: \"from the 17% coverage in 2019\". So that's 2019-01-01? Or just 2019? The previous rules say for dates without years, use the most recent year in the document. But here, the document mentions 2024 and 2019. The most recent is 2024, but the 2019 is a specific year. Wait, the user's previous example had \"2019 level\" normalized to 2019-01-01. So maybe 2019 would be 2019-01-01. So for \"2019\", normalized as 2019-01-01. Similarly, \"by the end of 2024\" would be 2024-12-31. But the schema's temporal_type can be \"date\" or \"interval\". Wait, the user's previous example had \"On March 15, 2022\" as a date. So for \"by the end of 2024\", maybe it's a date, but the end of the year. However, the exact date isn't given, so perhaps it's better to use the year as a date. But the user's previous example normalized \"March 15, 2022\" to \"2022-03-15\". So maybe \"by the end of 2024\" would be \"2024-12-31\". But the user's previous example didn't have such a case. Alternatively, maybe the temporal_type is \"date\" with the year, but the exact date isn't specified. Wait, the user's instruction says for dates without years, use the most recent year. But here, the text has \"by the end of 2024\" which is a date. So perhaps normalize to 2024-12-31. But maybe the user expects just the year. Hmm. Let me check the previous example again. The user had \"March 15, 2022\" normalized to \"2022-03-15\". So for \"by the end of 2024\", the normalized would be \"2024-12-31\". But maybe the user wants just the year. However, the schema allows for dates in ISO format. So I'll go with 2024-12-31 for \"by the end of 2024\". Similarly, \"in 2024\" would be 2024-01-01? Or maybe just the year. Wait, the user's previous example normalized \"March 15, 2022\" to \"2022-03-15\", so for \"in 2024\", maybe the entire year, but the temporal_type would be \"date\" with the year. But the exact date isn't given. Maybe the user expects the year as a date. Alternatively, perhaps the temporal_type is \"date\" with the year. But the exact date isn't specified. Hmm. Maybe the user wants the year as the normalized date. For example, \"in 2024\" would be \"2024\". But the previous example had a specific date. So perhaps for \"by the end of 2024\", it's 2024-12-31, and \"in 2024\" is 2024-01-01. But the user's previous example normalized \"March 15, 2022\" to \"2022-03-15\", so maybe for \"by the end of 2024\", it's 2024-12-31. But the user's instruction says for relative dates, use the most recent occurrence. Wait, the user's previous example had \"2019 level\" normalized to 2019-01-01. So maybe for \"2019\", it's 2019-01-01. So for \"by the end of 2024\", it's 2024-12-31. For \"in 2024\", maybe 2024-01-01. But the user's previous example had \"March 15, 2022\" as a date. So perhaps the temporal_type for \"by the end of 2024\" is \"date\" with 2024-12-31. Similarly, \"in 2024\" would be 2024-01-01. But maybe the user wants just the year. However, the schema requires ISO format. So I'll proceed with that.\n\nNext, spatial. The text mentions regions like WHO European Region, WHO Western Pacific Region, WHO African Region. These are regions, so location_type is \"region\", and parent_region would be \"World Health Organization\" or \"global\"? Wait, the previous example had \"Western Australia\" as a parent region. But here, the regions are part of WHO. So the parent_region might be \"World Health Organization\" or \"global\". But the user's previous example had \"Western Australia\" as a parent region. So for \"WHO European Region\", the parent_region would be \"World Health Organization\" or maybe \"global\"? But the user's previous example didn't have that. Alternatively, maybe the parent_region is \"global\" or \"World Health Organization\". But the user's previous example had \"Western Australia\" as a parent region. So perhaps for the WHO regions, the parent_region is \"World Health Organization\". But the user's previous example didn't have that. Alternatively, maybe the parent_region is \"global\" since they are regions within the WHO. But I'm not sure. The user's previous example had \"Western Australia\" as a parent region. So for \"WHO European Region\", the parent_region would be \"World Health Organization\" or \"global\". But the user's previous example didn't have that. Maybe the parent_region is \"global\" or \"World Health Organization\". But the user's previous example didn't have that. So perhaps the parent_region is \"global\" for these WHO regions. Alternatively, maybe the parent_region is \"World Health Organization\". But I'm not certain. However, the user's previous example had \"Western Australia\" as a parent region, so maybe for the WHO regions, the parent_region is \"World Health Organization\". But the user's previous example didn't have that. Hmm. Maybe the parent_region is \"global\" since they are regions within the WHO. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the parent_region is left blank. But the schema requires \"location_type\" and \"parent_region\" is optional. Wait, the schema for spatial says \"required\": [\"text\", \"location_type\"], so parent_region is optional. So for the WHO regions, the parent_region could be \"World Health Organization\" or \"global\". But the user's previous example didn't have that. So perhaps the parent_region is \"global\" for these regions. Alternatively, maybe the parent_region is not specified. But the user's previous example had \"Western Australia\" as a parent region. So for the WHO regions, the parent_region would be \"World Health Organization\". But I'm not sure. Maybe the user expects the parent_region to be \"global\" or \"World Health Organization\". I'll proceed with \"World Health Organization\" as the parent_region for the WHO regions.\n\nNext, event_type. The text is about vaccination coverage, so the event_type might be \"surveillance_update\" since it's about coverage statistics. The user's previous example had \"exposure site\" for a cyclone. But here, the text is about vaccination coverage, so the event_type could be \"surveillance_update\". The allowed categories include \"surveillance_update\". So for each mention of coverage, the event_type would be \"surveillance_update\". The confidence is 1.0 since it's factual.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention specific venues like hospitals or clinics. It's about vaccination programs in countries, so venue_type might not be applicable. But the schema requires it. Wait, the user's previous example had a venue_type for a cyclone hitting a hospital. But in this case, the text is about vaccination coverage in countries, so there's no specific venue. So venue_type might be empty. But the schema requires it. Wait, the schema for venue_type is an array, so if there are no venues, it's an empty array. But the user's previous example had venue_type entries. So in this case, since there are no specific venues mentioned, venue_type would be an empty array.\n\nDisease: The text mentions Hib, Hepatitis B, and HPV. For Hib, the category is \"hepatitis\" (since Hib is Haemophilus influenzae type b, which is a bacterial infection, but the user's allowed categories include \"hepatitis\" and \"other\". Wait, the user's allowed categories for disease are measles, influenza, covid19, pertussis, meningococcal, hepatitis, gastroenteritis, dengue, ross_river_virus, other. Hib is not in the list. So for Hib, the category would be \"other\". Similarly, Hepatitis B is in the list as \"hepatitis\". HPV is not in the list, so \"other\". So for Hib, category is \"other\", Hepatitis B is \"hepatitis\", HPV is \"other\". The disease_code is not provided, so it's empty.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nTemporal entries:\n- \"by the end of 2024\" \u2192 normalized to 2024-12-31, type date\n- \"in 2024\" \u2192 normalized to 2024-01-01, type date\n- \"2019\" \u2192 normalized to 2019-01-01, type date\n\nSpatial entries:\n- WHO European Region \u2192 location_type region, parent_region World Health Organization\n- WHO Western Pacific Region \u2192 same\n- WHO African Region \u2192 same\n\nEvent_type:\n- Each mention of coverage (Hib, Hep B, HPV) would be \"surveillance_update\" with confidence 1.0\n\nVenue_type: empty array\n\nDisease:\n- Hib \u2192 category other, disease_code empty\n- Hepatitis B \u2192 category hepatitis, disease_code empty\n- HPV \u2192 category other, disease_code empty\n\nWait, but the text mentions \"Hib vaccine\", \"hepatitis B vaccine\", and \"HPV vaccine\". So for each of these, the disease is Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b), Hepatitis B, and HPV. But the allowed categories for disease are as listed. Hib is not in the list, so \"other\". Hepatitis B is in the list as \"hepatitis\". HPV is not in the list, so \"other\".\n\nSo the JSON would have:\n\ntemporal: entries for 2024-12-31, 2024-01-01, 2019-01-01\n\nspatial: entries for each WHO region with parent_region as \"World Health Organization\"\n\nevent_type: entries for each disease mention as \"surveillance_update\"\n\nvenue_type: empty\n\ndisease: entries for each disease with their categories\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"by the end of 2024\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2024-12-31\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"in 2024\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2024-01-01\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"2019\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2019-01-01\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"WHO European Region\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"World Health Organization\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"WHO Western Pacific Region\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"World Health Organization\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"WHO African Region\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"World Health Organization\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Global coverage with 3 doses of Hib vaccine is estimated at 78%\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Global coverage with 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine is estimated at 84%\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Global coverage with the first dose of HPV among girls is now estimated at 31%\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Hib\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Hepatitis B\",\n      \"category\": \"hepatitis\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"HPV\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The 4% increase in global coverage since last year was driven by new introductions and scale up in several large countries and by a widespread improvement in existing programmes, including in countries using the 1-dose schedule.\n\nMalaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites transmitted to people through the bites of infected anopheline mosquitoes. It remains one of the leading causes of death among children in sub-Saharan Africa. The Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP), coordinated by WHO and conducted in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi from 2019 to 2023 demonstrated high public impact with a vaccine-attributable 13% reduction in all-cause mortality among children age-eligible for vaccination and substantial reduction in hospitalizations for severe malaria. Since 2024, malaria vaccines have been further introduced in national immunization schedules and scaled-up across Africa as part of integrated malaria control activities. At least 30 countries in Africa plan to introduce malaria vaccines into their childhood immunization programmes.\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus, which usually results in a high fever and rash, and can lead to blindness, encephalitis or death.",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a text and wants me to extract specific information into JSON based on the given schema. Let me start by reading through the text carefully.\n\nFirst, the temporal extraction. The text mentions \"17% coverage in 2019\" and \"since last year\" which would be 2023. The MVIP ran from 2019 to 2023. Then, since 2024, vaccines have been introduced. So I need to normalize these dates. The 2019 is already a year, so normalized as 2019-01-01. The 2023 is the end year, so 2023-12-31. The 2024 is the start of the year, so 2024-01-01. The \"since last year\" refers to 2023, so the interval would be from 2023-01-01 to 2023-12-31. Wait, but the text says \"4% increase in global coverage since last year was driven by new introductions and scale up... including in countries using the 1-dose schedule.\" So \"since last year\" would be from 2023-01-01 to the current date, but since the current date isn't specified, maybe just the start of 2023. Hmm, but the user's previous example used \"by the end of 2024\" as 2024-12-31. So maybe for \"since last year\" (which is 2023), the interval would be 2023-01-01 to 2023-12-31. Also, the MVIP ran from 2019 to 2023, so that's an interval from 2019-01-01 to 2023-12-31. Then the introduction since 2024 is a date of 2024-01-01.\n\nNext, spatial mentions. The text refers to \"sub-Saharan Africa\" as a region, so that's a location_type of region with parent_region as Africa. Also, the countries mentioned in the MVIP are Ghana, Kenya, and Malawi. Each of these is a country, so their parent_region would be Africa. Then, the countries planning to introduce vaccines are listed as \"at least 30 countries in Africa,\" but the text doesn't name them, so maybe just mention Africa as the parent_region for those. Wait, the user's previous example had \"low-income countries\" as a spatial reference. But in this case, the text mentions \"sub-Saharan Africa\" and the countries in the MVIP. So for each country listed (Ghana, Kenya, Malawi), they are countries with parent_region Africa. Also, the \"30 countries in Africa\" would be a region with parent_region Africa. But since the text doesn't specify the names, maybe just list Africa as the parent_region for those.\n\nEvent_type: The text talks about the Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP) which is a program, so maybe that's a surveillance_update or a vaccination_clinic? The MVIP is a program that demonstrated high public impact, so maybe \"surveillance_update\" or \"vaccination_clinic\". Alternatively, the introduction of vaccines into immunization schedules could be a \"vaccination_clinic\" or \"surveillance_update\". The text also mentions \"introduced in national immunization schedules\" which might be a vaccination_clinic. Also, the 4% increase in coverage is a surveillance_update. The measles section is a case report? Or maybe \"other\" since it's a description of the disease. Wait, the event_type categories include \"surveillance_update\" and \"vaccination_clinic\". The MVIP's results are a surveillance_update. The introduction of vaccines into schedules is a vaccination_clinic. The measles description is just a disease explanation, so maybe not an event_type. So I need to check each part.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention specific venues like hospitals or clinics, so maybe none here. Unless the MVIP is associated with a venue, but the text doesn't specify. So venue_type might be empty.\n\nDisease: The text mentions measles, malaria, and HPV. HPV is not in the allowed categories, so it's \"other\". Malaria is in the list, so category \"malaria\" (but the allowed categories don't have malaria, wait the allowed categories are measles, influenza, covid19, pertussis, meningococcal, hepatitis, gastroenteritis, dengue, ross_river_virus, other. So malaria isn't listed. So for malaria, it's \"other\". Similarly, HPV is \"other\". Measles is in the list. So for the diseases, measles is category measles, malaria is other, HPV is other.\n\nWait, the user's previous example had \"measles\" as a category. Let me check the allowed categories again. The disease categories are: measles, influenza, covid19, pertussis, meningococcal, hepatitis, gastroenteritis, dengue, ross_river_virus, other. So malaria isn't in the list, so it's \"other\". Similarly, HPV is not in the list, so \"other\". The text also mentions \"measles\" as a disease, so that's category measles. So the diseases would be measles, malaria (other), and HPV (other).\n\nNow, putting it all together. Let me structure each part.\n\nTemporal:\n- \"17% coverage in 2019\" \u2192 2019-01-01, date.\n- \"since last year\" \u2192 2023-01-01 to 2023-12-31, interval.\n- \"from 2019 to 2023\" \u2192 interval 2019-01-01/2023-12-31.\n- \"since 2024\" \u2192 2024-01-01, date.\n- \"2023\" \u2192 2023-12-31, date.\n\nWait, the text says \"from 2019 to 2023\" for the MVIP, so that's an interval. Also, \"since last year\" (2023) refers to the period from 2023-01-01 to the current date, but since the current date isn't specified, maybe just the start of 2023. But the user's previous example used \"by the end of 2024\" as 2024-12-31. So perhaps \"since last year\" is the interval from 2023-01-01 to 2023-12-31. Also, the 4% increase since last year is from 2023-01-01 to 2023-12-31. Then, the introduction since 2024 is a date of 2024-01-01.\n\nSpatial:\n- \"sub-Saharan Africa\" \u2192 region, parent_region Africa.\n- \"Ghana, Kenya, Malawi\" \u2192 country, parent_region Africa.\n- \"30 countries in Africa\" \u2192 region, parent_region Africa.\n\nEvent_type:\n- \"Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP)\" \u2192 surveillance_update (since it's a program's results).\n- \"introduced in national immunization schedules\" \u2192 vaccination_clinic.\n- \"measles is a highly contagious disease...\" \u2192 not an event, so maybe not included. The user's previous example had \"exposure site\" for a cyclone, but here the measles description is just a disease explanation, so maybe no event_type here.\n\nVenue_type: None, as no specific venues are mentioned.\n\nDisease:\n- \"measles\" \u2192 category measles.\n- \"malaria\" \u2192 category other.\n- \"HPV\" \u2192 category other.\n\nNow, checking the required fields. For each array, the required fields are present. For example, in temporal, text, normalized, temporal_type. For spatial, text and location_type. For event_type, text, category, confidence. Venue_type requires text, category, venue_name. But in this case, venue_type might be empty. Similarly, disease requires text, category, disease_code. The disease_code is not provided in the text, so maybe leave it as empty or use \"other\" for code? Wait, the schema says disease_code is a string, but the user's example had \"measles\" with code \"B01\" (assuming). But since the text doesn't provide codes, perhaps leave disease_code as empty or use \"other\" if applicable. However, the schema requires disease_code, so maybe it's optional? Wait, looking back at the schema, the required fields for disease are text, category, disease_code. So disease_code is required. But the text doesn't mention any codes, so perhaps set it to an empty string or \"other\". But the user's previous example had \"measles\" with code \"B01\". Since the text doesn't provide codes, maybe leave it as empty. However, the schema requires it, so perhaps set to empty string.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have the extracted data as per the schema.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"17% coverage in 2019\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2019-01-01\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"since last year\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2023-01-01/2023-12-31\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"interval\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"from 2019 to 2023\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2019-01-01/2023-12-31\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"interval\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"since 2024\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2024-01-01\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"2023\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2023-12-31\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"sub-Saharan Africa\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"Africa\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Ghana\",\n      \"location_type\": \"country\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"Africa\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Kenya\",\n      \"location_type\": \"country\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"Africa\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Malawi\",\n      \"location_type\": \"country\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"Africa\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"30 countries in Africa\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"Africa\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP) demonstrated high public impact\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"malaria vaccines introduced in national immunization schedules\",\n      \"category\": \"vaccination_clinic\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles\",\n      \"category\": \"measles\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"malaria\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"HPV\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

By the end of 2024, 84% of children had received 1 dose of measles-containing vaccine by their second birthday, and 76% of children received 2 doses of measles vaccine. By the end of 2024, 191 Member States had included a second dose of measles vaccine in their national immunization schedules.\n\nBacterial meningitis is an often-deadly infection which also leaves 1 in 5 individuals with long-term devastating sequelae after the acute phase. Before MenAfriVac introduction in 2010, meningococcus serogroup A (NmA) caused 80% of meningitis epidemics in the African meningitis belt. By end 2024, 24 of 26 countries in the belt conducted preventive campaigns, and 15 introduced MenAfriVac in their routine immunization programme, reaching 410 million people. Coverage is estimated at 60% in countries using MenAfriVac in routine immunization programmes and 29% overall in the 26 countries. No case of NmA meningitis has been confirmed in the belt since 2017. A gradual switch to a new pentavalent meningococcal ACWYX conjugate vaccine starting in 2025 will pave the way to make the meningitis belt history.\n\nMumps is a highly contagious virus that causes painful swelling at the side of the face under the ears (the parotid glands), fever, headache and muscle aches. It can lead to viral meningitis.",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a text about measles, meningitis, and mumps, and wants the JSON extraction based on the schema. \n\nFirst, I need to extract temporal expressions. The text mentions \"By the end of 2024\" which is a date. According to the previous rules, \"2024\" should be normalized to 2024-12-31. There's also \"starting in 2025\" which would be 2025-01-01. So two temporal entries.\n\nNext, spatial references. The text talks about the African meningitis belt, which is a region. The parent region would be Africa. Also, \"Western Australia\" was mentioned earlier, but the current text doesn't have new locations. Wait, the user's previous example had Broome, but in this text, the spatial mentions are the African meningitis belt. So I need to check if there are any other locations. The text doesn't mention specific cities or countries beyond the belt, so maybe just the belt as a region with parent Africa.\n\nFor event_type, the text discusses vaccination coverage and campaigns. The mention of \"preventive campaigns\" and \"routine immunization programme\" might fall under surveillance_update or vaccination_clinic. But the categories allowed are exposure_site, case_report, etc. The text is more about vaccination efforts, so maybe \"surveillance_update\" with confidence 0.8. Also, the introduction of vaccines could be a vaccination_clinic, but the text doesn't specify a venue. Maybe \"surveillance_update\" is better here.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention specific venues like hospitals or clinics, so maybe none here. But the user's previous example had a venue, but this text doesn't have that. So venue_type array might be empty.\n\nDisease categories: Measles is explicitly mentioned, so category \"measles\". Meningitis is mentioned, which maps to \"meningococcal\". Mumps is another disease, but the allowed categories don't have mumps. So mumps would be \"other\". Wait, the allowed categories for disease include measles, meningococcal, etc. So for mumps, since it's not listed, it's \"other\". \n\nWait, the user's schema for disease has categories like measles, meningococcal, etc. So the text mentions measles, meningitis (which is meningococcal), and mumps. So for each disease:\n\n- Measles: category measles, code maybe ICD-10 B05.\n- Meningitis: category meningococcal, code maybe A38.8 (but not sure, but the schema allows disease_code as a string, so maybe leave it empty or use a placeholder).\n- Mumps: category other, code maybe B06. \n\nBut the user's example had disease_code as optional. Wait, the schema requires disease_code. Wait, looking back: the required fields for disease are text, category, disease_code. So I need to include disease_code. But the user's example had \"measles\" with code \"B05\". So I'll assign codes where possible. For meningococcal, maybe A38.8, but not sure. Alternatively, use the ICD-10 code for meningococcal meningitis, which is A38.8. For mumps, it's B06. \n\nSo compiling all that:\n\nTemporal entries: end of 2024 \u2192 2024-12-31, start 2025 \u2192 2025-01-01.\n\nSpatial: African meningitis belt as region, parent Africa.\n\nEvent_type: surveillance_update for the vaccination coverage and campaigns, confidence 0.8.\n\nVenue_type: none.\n\nDiseases: measles, meningococcal, mumps (other). \n\nWait, the text says \"bacterial meningitis\" which is meningococcal, so category meningococcal. Mumps is a separate virus, so category other. \n\nSo the JSON should have these entries. Let me structure them accordingly.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"By the end of 2024\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2024-12-31\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"starting in 2025\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2025-01-01\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"African meningitis belt\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"Africa\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"24 of 26 countries in the belt conducted preventive campaigns\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.8\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles\",\n      \"category\": \"measles\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"B05\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"meningitis\",\n      \"category\": \"meningococcal\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"A38.8\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"mumps\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"B06\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a text about mumps, pneumococcal diseases, and polio, along with vaccination coverage data. I need to extract temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, and disease information as per the schema.\n\nFirst, temporal expressions. The text mentions \"by the end of 2024\" for mumps and pneumococcal vaccines. According to the previous rules, \"by the end of 2024\" normalizes to 2024-12-31. There's also \"In 2024\" which is a date, so 2024-01-01. Then \"2023\" would be 2023-12-31. So I need to list each occurrence with their normalized dates.\n\nNext, spatial mentions. The text refers to WHO regions: South-East Asia Region and Western Pacific Region. These are regions, so location_type is region. Parent_region would be the WHO, but the user's previous examples had parent regions like countries. Wait, the user's previous spatial references included countries like Ghana, Kenya, etc. But here, the regions are part of WHO, so maybe parent_region is \"WHO\" or leave it as is. The schema allows parent_region, so I'll include them as regions under WHO.\n\nEvent_type: The text talks about vaccine introductions and coverage. The categories allowed include surveillance_update, risk_warning, etc. Since it's about vaccine coverage and disease status, maybe \"surveillance_update\" or \"risk_warning\". But the text is more about reporting coverage and status, so \"surveillance_update\" seems appropriate. Confidence is 1.0 as it's factual.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention specific venues like hospitals or clinics. So maybe no entries here, but the schema requires an array. Wait, the user's previous example had venue_type, but in this text, there's no mention of venues. So perhaps an empty array.\n\nDisease: The text mentions mumps, pneumococcal diseases (which is a category, but the allowed categories don't have a specific one. The closest is \"other\" or maybe \"meningococcal\" if it's part of that. Wait, pneumococcal is a type of bacteria causing diseases like meningitis. The allowed categories include \"meningococcal\" but that's a different pathogen. So \"other\" might be the safest choice. Similarly, polio is a separate category. So for mumps, category is \"other\" since it's not in the list. Wait, the allowed categories for disease include \"other\". So mumps would be \"other\", pneumococcal diseases would be \"other\", and polio is \"other\" as well. Wait, but polio isn't listed. So all three would be \"other\" with disease_code as ICD-10 codes if possible. But the user didn't provide codes, so maybe leave disease_code empty. Wait, the schema requires disease_code, but the user's example had \"measles\" with category \"measles\" and disease_code. So for mumps, it's \"other\" and disease_code is empty? Or maybe the user expects to map to the closest category. But since mumps isn't in the list, it's \"other\". Same for pneumococcal and polio.\n\nWait, the allowed disease categories are measles, influenza, covid19, pertussis, meningococcal, hepatitis, gastroenteritis, dengue, ross_river_virus, other. So mumps is not in the list, so \"other\". Pneumococcal diseases are not a category, so \"other\". Polio is not listed, so \"other\". So all three entries would be under \"other\".\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nTemporal entries: \"by the end of 2024\" \u2192 2024-12-31, \"In 2024\" \u2192 2024-01-01, \"2023\" \u2192 2023-12-31.\n\nSpatial entries: WHO South-East Asia Region (region, parent_region: WHO?), same for Western Pacific Region.\n\nEvent_type: \"surveillance_update\" with confidence 1.0.\n\nVenue_type: empty array.\n\nDisease: mumps, pneumococcal, polio all as \"other\".\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"by the end of 2024\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2024-12-31\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"In 2024\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2024-01-01\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"2023\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2023-12-31\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"WHO South-East Asia Region\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"WHO\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"WHO Western Pacific Region\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"WHO\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Pneumococcal vaccine had been introduced in 163 Member States by the end of 2024\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"polio has been stopped in all countries except for Afghanistan and Pakistan\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"mumps\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"pneumococcal diseases\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"polio\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Rotavirus vaccine was introduced in 131 countries by the end of 2024. Global coverage was estimated at 59%.\n\nRubella is a viral disease which is usually mild in children, but infection during early pregnancy may cause fetal death or congenital rubella syndrome, which can lead to defects of the brain, heart, eyes and ears. Rubella vaccine was introduced nationwide in 178 Member States by the end of 2024, and global coverage was estimated at 73%.\n\nTetanus is caused by a bacterium which grows in the absence of oxygen, for example in dirty wounds or the umbilical cord if it is not kept clean. The spores of C. tetani are present in the environment irrespective of geographical location. It produces a toxin which can cause serious complications or death. Maternal and neonatal tetanus persist as public health problems in 10 countries, Afghanistan, Angola, Central African Republic, Nigeria, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan and Yemen.\n\nYellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes.",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a text about various diseases and their vaccine introductions. I need to extract temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, and disease information.\n\nFirst, looking at the temporal part. The text mentions \"by the end of 2024\" for the rotavirus vaccine. According to the previous temporal references, \"by the end of 2024\" should be normalized to 2024-12-31. There's another mention of \"by the end of 2024\" for rubella vaccine, same normalization. The other parts don't have dates, so no temporal entries there.\n\nNext, spatial references. The text lists countries like Afghanistan, Angola, etc., for tetanus. Each of these is a country, so location_type is country. No parent regions mentioned here, so parent_region is omitted. The other parts don't have specific locations.\n\nFor event_type, the text talks about vaccine introductions and coverage. The categories allowed include surveillance_update or risk_warning. Since it's about vaccine introduction and coverage, maybe surveillance_update. But the user's previous example had \"risk_warning\" for polio. Wait, the first sentence says countries are at risk of polio importation. That sounds like a risk_warning. Then the other parts about vaccines might be surveillance_update. But the user's example had \"exposure_site\" for a cyclone, which might not apply here. Need to check the allowed categories again. The event_type categories are exposure_site, case_report, outbreak_alert, risk_warning, surveillance_update, vaccination_clinic, other. The text mentions vaccine introduction and coverage, which might fall under surveillance_update. But the first part about polio risk is a risk_warning. So I'll have two entries: one for polio risk as risk_warning, and others as surveillance_update.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention specific venues like hospitals or clinics, so venue_type might be empty. The previous example had a venue, but this text doesn't have that.\n\nDisease: The text lists polio, rotavirus, rubella, tetanus, yellow fever. Each of these needs to be mapped to the categories. Polio is \"other\" since it's not in the list. Rotavirus is in the list as \"rotavirus\" but the category options don't have it. Wait, the allowed categories for disease are measles, influenza, covid19, pertussis, meningococcal, hepatitis, gastroenteritis, dengue, ross_river_virus, other. Rotavirus isn't listed, so it's \"other\". Similarly, rubella is not in the list, so \"other\". Tetanus is not listed, so \"other\". Yellow fever is not listed, so \"other\". So all these diseases will be categorized as \"other\" with their names.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have temporal entries for 2024-12-31, spatial entries for the listed countries, event_type entries for risk_warning and surveillance_update, and disease entries as other.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"by the end of 2024\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2024-12-31\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"by the end of 2024\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2024-12-31\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Afghanistan\",\n      \"location_type\": \"country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Angola\",\n      \"location_type\": \"country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Central African Republic\",\n      \"location_type\": \"country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Nigeria\",\n      \"location_type\": \"country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Pakistan\",\n      \"location_type\": \"country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Papua New Guinea\",\n      \"location_type\": \"country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Somalia\",\n      \"location_type\": \"country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Sudan\",\n      \"location_type\": \"country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"South Sudan\",\n      \"location_type\": \"country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Yemen\",\n      \"location_type\": \"country\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"all countries remain at risk of importation of polio\",\n      \"category\": \"risk_warning\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Rotavirus vaccine was introduced in 131 countries by the end of 2024\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Rubella vaccine was introduced nationwide in 178 Member States by the end of 2024\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Maternal and neonatal tetanus persist as public health problems in 10 countries\",\n      \"category\": \"risk_warning\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"polio\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Rotaviruses\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Rubella\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Tetanus\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Yellow fever\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Of the 19.9 million, around 55% of these children live in 10 countries: Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sudan and Yemen.\n\nMonitoring data at subnational levels is critical to helping countries prioritize and tailor vaccination strategies and operational plans to address immunization gaps and reach every person with life-saving vaccines.\n\nWHO response\n\nWHO is working with countries and partners to improve global vaccination coverage, including through these initiatives adopted by the World Health Assembly in August 2020.\n\nImmunization Agenda 2030\n\nIA2030 sets an ambitious, overarching global vision and strategy for vaccines and immunization for the decade 2021\u20132030. It was co-created with thousands of contributions from countries and organizations around the world.",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a text about yellow fever vaccination coverage and asked for JSON extraction based on specific schemas. First, I need to parse the text and identify all the required elements: temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, and disease.\n\nStarting with temporal expressions. The text mentions \"As of 2024\" which is a date. According to the rules, \"2024\" should be normalized to 2024-12-31. Then there's \"In 2024\" which is another date, normalized to 2024-01-01. Also, \"14.3 million infants did not receive an initial dose of DTP vaccine\" \u2013 this is a fact but not a temporal expression. So I'll extract the two dates.\n\nNext, spatial mentions. The text lists several countries: tan, Papua New Guinea, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Yemen. Wait, \"tan\" might be a typo for \"Tanzania\"? But the user's previous example had \"Broome, Western Australia\" with parent region. So for each country listed, the location_type is country, and parent_region is empty since they are countries. However, the user's previous example had \"Western Australia\" as the parent region for Broome. But in this case, the countries listed are already sovereign states, so parent_region might not apply. But the schema requires parent_region, so maybe leave it as empty or not include? Wait, the schema for spatial requires \"text\" and \"location_type\", and \"parent_region\" is optional. Wait, looking back, the required fields are \"text\" and \"location_type\". So for each country, location_type is country, and parent_region is not required. But the user's previous example included parent_region. However, in the current text, the countries listed are individual countries, so their parent_region would be the continent? But the user's previous example had \"Western Australia\" as the parent region for Broome. So maybe for Sudan and South Sudan, the parent_region is Africa? But the user's previous spatial references included \"WHO South-East Asia Region\" and \"WHO Western Pacific Region\", but in this text, the countries are listed as individual countries. So perhaps the parent_region is not applicable here, so we can omit it or set to empty. But the schema allows parent_region as a property. So I'll include it as empty or maybe the continent. However, the user's previous example didn't include continents. Maybe the parent_region is not needed here. Let me check the user's previous example again. In the first example, the spatial entry was \"Broome, Western Australia\" with parent_region \"Western Australia\". So for countries, the parent_region might be the continent. But the user's previous spatial references included regions like WHO South-East Asia Region. However, in this text, the countries are listed as individual countries. So perhaps the parent_region is not applicable, so we can leave it as empty. But the schema doesn't require it. So for each country listed, the spatial entry would have text as the country name, location_type as country, and parent_region as empty or not included. Wait, the schema for spatial requires \"text\" and \"location_type\", and \"parent_region\" is optional. So I'll include parent_region as empty or not include. But the user's previous example included parent_region. Maybe the user expects parent_region to be the continent. For example, Sudan and South Sudan are in Africa. But the user's previous example had \"Western Australia\" as the parent region for Broome. So perhaps for each country, the parent_region is the continent. However, the user's previous spatial references included regions like WHO South-East Asia Region. But in this case, the countries are listed as individual countries. So maybe the parent_region is not applicable here. Therefore, I'll include the country names with location_type as country and parent_region as empty. But the user's previous example included parent_region. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the user expects the parent_region to be the WHO region. For example, Sudan is in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region. But the user's previous spatial references included WHO regions. However, the text here doesn't mention WHO regions, just countries. So perhaps the parent_region is not applicable. Therefore, I'll list each country with location_type as country and parent_region as empty. But the user's previous example had parent_region for Broome as Western Australia. So maybe for countries, the parent_region is the continent. But the user's previous example didn't mention continents. This is a bit ambiguous. However, the user's instruction says to include parent region for disambiguation. Since the countries are individual, maybe the parent_region is not needed. So I'll proceed without parent_region for these countries.\n\nNext, event_type. The text mentions \"yellow fever vaccine had been introduced in routine infant immunization programmes\" and \"Monitoring data at subnational levels is critical...\" and \"WHO is working with countries...\" and \"Immunization Agenda 2030\". The event_type categories include surveillance_update, vaccination_clinic, etc. The text talks about vaccination coverage, challenges, WHO response, and initiatives. The event_type could be \"surveillance_update\" because it's about monitoring data and immunization gaps. Also, the WHO response might be a \"risk_warning\" or \"surveillance_update\". The \"Immunization Agenda 2030\" is a strategy, so maybe \"surveillance_update\" or \"vaccination_clinic\"? Alternatively, \"surveillance_update\" fits because it's about monitoring and addressing gaps. So I'll categorize the event_type as \"surveillance_update\" with confidence 1.0.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention specific venues like hospitals or clinics. It talks about immunization programs and WHO initiatives, but no specific venues. So venue_type might be empty.\n\nDisease: The text mentions \"yellow fever\" which is a disease.

They want me to extract specific information into JSON based on the schema they provided.\n\nFirst, I need to look for temporal expressions. The document mentions \"2021\u20132030\" and \"In 2020\". The first is a duration, so I'll normalize it to \"P10Y\". The second is a date, so \"2020-01-01\". I should check if there are any other dates, but it seems those are the main ones.\n\nNext, spatial references. The text talks about \"low- and middle-income countries\" and \"Member States\", but those are too generic. The user's previous spatial references included specific countries like South Sudan, so maybe there's a need to check if any specific locations are mentioned. However, in this document, there are no specific cities or regions mentioned, so the spatial array might be empty or include \"global\" as a parent region. Wait, the user's previous spatial references had countries listed, but this document doesn't mention any specific locations. So maybe spatial is empty? Or perhaps \"global\" as a parent region? Hmm, the schema requires location_type and text. Since there are no specific locations, maybe spatial is empty.\n\nFor event_type, the document discusses strategies and agendas, which might fall under \"surveillance_update\" or \"other\". The Immunization Agenda 2030 is a strategy, so maybe \"surveillance_update\" with confidence 0.8. Also, the cervical cancer strategy could be another event_type as \"risk_warning\" or \"surveillance_update\". But the categories allowed are exposure_site, case_report, etc. Since it's a strategy, maybe \"surveillance_update\" is the best fit.\n\nVenue_type: The document doesn't mention specific venues like hospitals or clinics. It's about strategies and global initiatives, so venue_type might be empty.\n\nDisease: The text mentions \"cervical cancer\" and \"HPV vaccine\". Cervical cancer isn't in the allowed categories, so it's \"other\". Also, \"Ebola\" and \"COVID-19\" are mentioned. Ebola is not in the list, so \"other\", and COVID-19 is allowed. So I need to extract those.\n\nPutting it all together, temporal has two entries: the duration and the date. Spatial might be empty. Event_type could have \"surveillance_update\" and \"risk_warning\" with confidence. Venue_type is empty. Disease includes COVID-19 and others for Ebola and cervical cancer.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"2021\u20132030\",\n      \"normalized\": \"P10Y\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"duration\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"In 2020\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2020-01-01\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"global strategy towards eliminating cervical cancer as a public health problem\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.8\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"global strategy towards eliminating cervical cancer as a public health problem\",\n      \"category\": \"risk_warning\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.7\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"cervical cancer\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"COVID-19\",\n      \"category\": \"covid19\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"U071\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Ebola\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a block of text related to vaccination coverage targets and WHO information. They want me to extract specific data into JSON based on the schema they provided.\n\nFirst, I need to check for temporal expressions. The text mentions \"next 10 years\" and \"2030 targets.\" The \"next 10 years\" is a duration, so I should normalize that as P10Y. The \"2030 targets\" is a date, so I'll use 2030-01-01. But wait, the user's previous example used \"by the end of 2024\" as 2024-12-31. However, here it's just \"2030 targets,\" so maybe it's the start of the year. But the instruction says for dates without years, use the most recent year in the document. Since the document context's current position is Chunk 11 of 11, but the publication date is unknown. However, the related news mentions \"15 July 2025,\" so maybe the most recent year is 2025. Wait, but the user's previous example had a date in 2022, and the current context's publication date is unknown. Hmm, maybe I should use the year mentioned in the text. The text says \"2030 targets,\" so that's a date, so normalized as 2030-01-01. The \"next 10 years\" is a duration, so P10Y.\n\nNext, spatial references. The text mentions regions like Africa, Americas, etc., but those are listed under \"Regions\" in the text. However, the user's previous example had specific locations like Broome, Western Australia. In this text, the regions listed are Africa, Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, South-East Asia, Western Pacific. These are all regions, so location_type would be \"region\" and parent_region might be \"World\" or \"Global,\" but the schema doesn't specify. Wait, the spatial extraction requires parent_region for disambiguation. Since these are regions of the world, maybe the parent_region is \"World\" or \"Global.\" But the user's previous example had \"Western Australia\" as the parent_region for Broome. So for each region listed, like Africa, the parent_region could be \"World\" or \"Global.\" But the schema's parent_region is a string, so I can list them as \"World\" or \"Global.\" However, the user's previous example didn't have parent_region for regions, but in the first example, Broome had parent_region as \"Western Australia.\" So maybe for the regions listed here, the parent_region is \"World\" or \"Global.\" But the exact parent might not be clear. Alternatively, since these are regions of the WHO, maybe the parent_region is \"WHO regions.\" But the user's previous example didn't have that. Hmm, perhaps I should list them as \"region\" with parent_region as \"World\" or \"Global.\" But the exact parent might not be specified. Alternatively, maybe the regions are already parent regions, so their parent_region is empty. But the schema requires \"parent_region\" to be present. Wait, the schema for spatial says \"parent_region\" is optional? No, looking back, the required fields for spatial are \"text\" and \"location_type.\" Parent_region is not required. So maybe I can omit it. Wait, the schema for spatial has \"required\": [\"text\", \"location_type\"], so parent_region is optional. So for the regions listed, like Africa, the location_type is \"region,\" and parent_region can be left out or set to \"World.\" But the user's previous example included parent_region. Maybe in this case, since the regions are part of the WHO's regions, the parent_region is \"World.\" But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the text lists them as regions, maybe they are top-level regions, so parent_region is not applicable. But the schema allows for parent_region. Maybe I should include them as \"World\" as the parent_region. Alternatively, since the user's previous example had \"Western Australia\" as the parent_region for Broome, which is a state, then for the regions listed here, the parent_region could be \"Global\" or \"World.\" I'll proceed with that.\n\nNext, event_type. The text talks about vaccination coverage targets, so the event_type might be \"surveillance_update\" or \"risk_warning.\" The text mentions \"programme improvements to reach the 90% coverage targets,\" which sounds like a surveillance update or a risk warning. The allowed categories include \"surveillance_update\" and \"risk_warning.\" Since the text is about targets and improvements, maybe \"surveillance_update\" is more appropriate. The confidence would be 0.8 or 0.9, but I need to check. The text also mentions \"Global Vaccine Action Plan\" and \"World Immunization Week,\" which are related to vaccination programs, so maybe \"surveillance_update\" is the best fit. Alternatively, \"risk_warning\" if there's a mention of risks, but the text is more about targets and improvements. So I'll go with \"surveillance_update\" with confidence 0.8.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention any specific venues like hospitals, clinics, etc. So venue_type array would be empty.\n\nDisease: The text doesn't mention any specific diseases, so the disease array would be empty.\n\nPutting it all together, the temporal entries are \"next 10 years\" as P10Y and \"2030 targets\" as 2030-01-01. The spatial entries are the regions listed, each as \"region\" with parent_region \"World.\" The event_type is \"surveillance_update\" with confidence 0.8. Venue_type and disease are empty arrays.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"next 10 years\",\n      \"normalized\": \"P10Y\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"duration\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"2030 targets\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2030-01-01\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Africa\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Americas\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Eastern Mediterranean\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Europe\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"South-East Asia\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Western Pacific\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"programme improvements to reach the 90% coverage targets\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.8\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": []\n}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a JSON schema and a previous example, but the current input is a webpage snippet from the WHO site. The task is to extract specific fields: temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, and disease.\n\nFirst, looking at the input text: \"When autocomplete results are available use up and down arrows to review and enter to select.\" This seems like a UI instruction, not relevant for extraction. Then there's \"Home\" and other navigation links, which are probably not containing any of the required data. \n\nThe next part mentions \"Dengue\" and \"Mpox\" as popular topics, and regions like Africa, Americas, etc. But these are just headings or categories. The \"Latest\" section lists disease outbreak news, situation reports, etc., but no specific events. The \"Disease Outbreak News\" link might be a potential source, but the text provided doesn't include any actual outbreak details. \n\nLooking for temporal expressions: there's no date, time, or duration mentioned in the given text. The user's previous example had a date, but here, the text doesn't have any. So temporal array would be empty.\n\nSpatial mentions: The regions listed (Africa, Americas, etc.) are parent regions, but the text doesn't specify a location type like city or country. So spatial might not have entries here.\n\nEvent_type: The text mentions \"Disease Outbreak News\" and \"Situation reports,\" which could relate to outbreak_alert or surveillance_update. But without specific event details, it's hard to categorize. The previous example had an event_type, but here, maybe \"outbreak_alert\" with low confidence?\n\nVenue_type: There's no mention of venues like hospitals or clinics in the text provided. So venue_type would be empty.\n\nDisease: The text lists diseases like Dengue and Mpox, which are in the allowed categories. So disease entries for Dengue and Mpox with category \"dengue\" and \"mpox\" respectively, and disease_code as their codes if known. But the user's previous example used \"measles\" with category and code. However, in the given text, there's no code mentioned, so maybe leave disease_code as empty or use \"other\" if not applicable. Wait, the schema requires disease_code, but the example in the history had \"disease_code\": \"B01\" for measles. However, in the current input, the text just mentions the disease names without codes. So perhaps the disease entries would have category as \"dengue\" and \"mpox\" with disease_code as empty or maybe using the ICD-10 codes. But since the text doesn't provide codes, maybe set disease_code to empty string or \"other\"? The schema requires disease_code, so maybe it's better to include it as empty.\n\nBut the user's previous example had \"disease_code\": \"B01\" for measles. However, in the current input, the text doesn't mention any specific disease codes. So perhaps the disease entries would be for Dengue and Mpox with category and disease_code as empty. Wait, the schema requires disease_code, so maybe it's mandatory. But the user's previous example had it. So in this case, since the text mentions Dengue and Mpox, but no codes, maybe set disease_code to empty string. However, the schema's required fields include disease_code, so it's necessary. But the user's example had \"disease_code\": \"B01\" for measles. So perhaps in this case, the disease_code is not provided, so maybe leave it as empty. But the schema requires it, so maybe the user expects it. Alternatively, maybe the disease_code is not required, but the schema says it is. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. \n\nIn the absence of specific codes, perhaps the best is to list the disease names with category and leave disease_code as empty. But the schema requires it. So maybe the answer would have disease entries with category and disease_code as empty. However, the user's previous example had disease_code, so maybe the assistant should include it even if empty. \n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would have disease entries for Dengue and Mpox with category and disease_code as empty. But the user's example had \"other\" for disease when not applicable. Wait, the previous example had \"measles\" with category \"measles\" and disease_code \"B01\". So in this case, for Dengue, the category is \"dengue\" and disease_code would be \"A15\" (ICD-10 code for Dengue). Similarly, Mpox is \"B03\" (ICD-10 code for Smallpox, but Mpox is a different virus, so maybe the code is different. However, the user's schema allows \"other\" as a category. Wait, the disease categories include \"dengue\" and \"mpox\" as options. So if the text mentions \"Dengue\", the category is \"dengue\", and disease_code would be the ICD-10 code. But since the text doesn't provide the code, maybe the assistant should leave it as empty. However, the schema requires disease_code, so perhaps it's better to include it as empty. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant should use the category and leave disease_code as empty. But the schema requires it. So the answer would have disease entries with category and disease_code as empty. But the user's previous example had disease_code filled. So perhaps the assistant should include the code even if not present. \n\nIn conclusion, the JSON would have disease entries for Dengue and Mpox with category and disease_code as empty, but since the schema requires disease_code, it's necessary to include it. However, without specific codes, the assistant might have to leave it as empty. \n\nSo the final JSON would have empty arrays for temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, and disease entries with category and disease_code as empty. But the user's previous example had entries, so maybe the assistant should check if any of the text mentions diseases. The text mentions \"Dengue\" and \"Mpox\" as topics, so those would be the disease entries. The disease_code for Dengue is A15, and for Mpox, it's B03 (though Mpox is a different virus, but the category is \"mpox\"). So the assistant should map those. \n\nTherefore, the disease array would have entries for Dengue and Mpox with their respective categories and disease codes. But since the text doesn't mention the codes, maybe the assistant should use the category and leave disease_code as empty. However, the schema requires disease_code, so perhaps the assistant should include it as empty. \n\nIn the end, the JSON would have the disease entries with category and disease_code as empty, but the user's example had disease_code filled. So maybe the assistant should use the category and leave disease_code as empty. \n\nSo the final answer would have the disease array with entries for Dengue and Mpox, each with category and disease_code as empty. But the schema requires disease_code, so it's necessary to include it. Therefore, the assistant should include the disease_code as empty strings.\n</think>\n\n{\"temporal\":[],\"spatial\":[],\"event_type\":[],\"venue_type\":[],\"disease\":[{\"text\":\"Dengue\",\"category\":\"dengue\",\"disease_code\":\"\"},{\"text\":\"Mpox\",\"category\":\"mpox\",\"disease_code\":\"\"}]}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a block of text about WHO's website content related to immunization. They want me to extract specific information into JSON based on the schema they provided.\n\nFirst, I need to check for temporal expressions. The text mentions \"Immunization is a global health success story, saving millions of lives every year.\" The phrase \"every year\" suggests a recurring event, but there's no specific date or time mentioned. So, maybe there's no temporal data here. I'll note that there are no temporal entries.\n\nNext, spatial mentions. The text doesn't have any specific locations like cities or countries. It's about global health, so maybe \"global\" is a location type. But the schema's spatial requires a location_type and text. \"Global\" might fit as a region or other. However, the example in the previous interaction had a city with a parent region. Since there's no specific place here, perhaps no spatial data either.\n\nEvent type: The text talks about immunization efforts, which could be considered a surveillance update or a vaccination clinic. But the exact event type isn't clear. The categories include vaccination_clinic, which might fit. However, the text doesn't explicitly mention an event like a clinic or a report. So maybe \"other\" with low confidence.\n\nVenue type: The text doesn't mention any specific venues like hospitals or clinics. It's more about programs and initiatives, so no venue data.\n\nDisease: The text mentions preventing diseases but doesn't name specific ones. The example had measles, but here it's general. So maybe \"other\" for disease.\n\nWait, the user's previous example had a cyclone event with a venue type. But in this case, the text is about WHO's data and immunization programs. There's no specific event, venue, or disease named. So all categories might be empty. But the schema requires arrays, so even if empty, they should be present. Let me check the required fields again. The required array is empty, so maybe it's okay to have empty arrays. But the user's previous response had some entries. However, in this case, there's no data to extract. So the JSON should have all arrays empty. But I need to make sure I'm not missing any hidden mentions. Let me scan again.\n\nThe text says \"vaccines to prevent more than 30 life-threatening diseases.\" But it doesn't name them. So disease would be \"other\" with text as \"more than 30 life-threatening diseases\". But the category options don't have a general \"diseases\" category. The allowed categories are specific. So maybe \"other\" for disease. Similarly, event_type could be \"surveillance_update\" or \"vaccination_clinic\" but not sure. The text is about immunization programs, which might be considered a vaccination_clinic, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, \"other\" with confidence 0.5.\n\nBut the user's previous example had a cyclone event with a venue type. In this case, the text is about WHO's initiatives, so maybe no event_type. But the schema allows for \"other\" in event_type. So perhaps:\n\nevent_type: [\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Immunization is a global health success story...\",\n    \"category\": \"other\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.5\n  }\n]\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's no event_type here. The same applies to venue_type and disease. Since the user's previous example had some entries, but this text doesn't have specific data, maybe all arrays are empty. However, the user's schema allows for empty arrays. So the final JSON would have all arrays empty. But I need to check the required fields. The required array in the schema is empty, so it's acceptable. Therefore, the JSON should have all properties as empty arrays.\n</think>\n\n{\"temporal\":[],\"spatial\":[],\"event_type\":[],\"venue_type\":[],\"disease\":[]}",

Immunization currently prevents 3.5 million to 5 million deaths every year from diseases like diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), influenza and measles.\n\nImmunization is key to primary health care, an indisputable human right, and one of the best health investments money can buy. Vaccines are also critical to the prevention and control of infectious disease outbreaks. They underpin global health security and are a vital tool in the battle against antimicrobial resistance.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic strained health systems, resulting in dramatic setbacks. The most recent data for diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DTP) immunization coverage underscores the need for ongoing catch-up, recovery and system-strengthening.\n\nMeasles, because of its high transmissibility, quickly exposes immunity. In 2024, the routine first dose of measles vaccine was missed by 20.6 million children \u2013 far from the 2019 level of 19.3 million children.\n\nImpact\n\nVaccines train your immune system to create antibodies, just as it does when it\u2019s exposed to a disease. However, because vaccines contain only killed or weakened forms of germs like viruses or bacteria, they do not cause the disease or put you at risk of its complications.\n\nVaccines protect against many different diseases, including:",

I need to extract temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, and disease information.\n\nFirst, looking for temporal expressions. The text mentions \"In 2024, the routine first dose of measles vaccine was missed by 20.6 million children\" and \"the most recent data for diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DTP) immunization coverage underscores the need for ongoing catch-up, recovery and system-strengthening.\" The year 2024 is a date, so normalized as 2024-01-01 since no specific month/day. The DTP data is from the most recent data, which might be 2024, but the text doesn't specify. Maybe just 2024 as the year.\n\nNext, spatial mentions. The text doesn't have specific locations like cities or countries. So spatial might be empty.\n\nFor event_type, the text talks about immunization coverage and measles vaccine doses missed. That sounds like a surveillance update or a risk warning. The category could be \"surveillance_update\" with confidence 0.8 since it's about data and coverage.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention specific venues like hospitals or clinics, so this might be empty.\n\nDiseases mentioned are measles, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, influenza. Each should be in the disease array. Measles is a category, others like diphtheria are under \"other\" since the allowed categories don't include them. Wait, the allowed categories for disease are measles, influenza, covid19, pertussis, meningococcal, hepatitis, gastroenteritis, dengue, ross_river_virus, other. So diphtheria and tetanus would fall under \"other\". Similarly, influenza is a category. So for each disease, assign the correct category. For example, measles is \"measles\", influenza is \"influenza\", pertussis is \"pertussis\", and others like diphtheria, tetanus, meningococcal, etc., would be \"other\".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have temporal entries for 2024, event_type as surveillance_update, diseases with their respective categories.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"In 2024, the routine first dose of measles vaccine was missed by 20.6 million children\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2024-01-01\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"The most recent data for diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DTP) immunization coverage underscores the need for ongoing catch-up\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.8\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles\",\n      \"category\": \"measles\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"diphtheria\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"tetanus\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"pertussis\",\n      \"category\": \"pertussis\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"influenza\",\n      \"category\": \"influenza\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a text about vaccines and diseases, and they want me to extract specific information into JSON. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the temporal extraction. The text mentions \"August 2020\" in the context of the WHO Immunization Agenda 2030. So I need to normalize that date. Since it's a date, the ISO format would be 2020-08. But wait, the exact date isn't specified, just the month and year. The user's previous example used \"2024-01-01\" for a relative date. Here, \"August 2020\" is a specific month, so I should use 2020-08 as the normalized date. The temporal_type would be \"date\".\n\nNext, spatial mentions. The text doesn't have any specific locations like cities or countries. It talks about WHO working with countries, but there's no specific place mentioned. So maybe the spatial array is empty. Wait, the user's previous example had a location, but this text doesn't have any. So spatial should be an empty array.\n\nFor event_type, the text discusses WHO initiatives and vaccination coverage. The main event here is the adoption of the Immunization Agenda 2030 by the World Health Assembly. The category could be \"surveillance_update\" since it's about global vaccination efforts. Confidence is 1.0 because it's a direct mention. So event_type would have an entry with the text referencing the agenda and the category.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention any specific venues like hospitals or clinics. It's more about initiatives and programs, so venue_type should be empty.\n\nDisease extraction: The text lists several diseases like measles, influenza, COVID-19, etc. Each of these should be in the disease array. For each, the category is the corresponding enum value, and the disease_code is \"other\" since they don't have specific codes mentioned. Wait, the user's schema requires disease_code to be ICD-10 or SNOMED. But the text doesn't provide codes, so maybe \"other\" is acceptable. However, the example in the previous response used \"measles\" as the category and \"other\" for disease_code. Wait, no, in the previous example, the disease_code was missing. Wait, looking back, the user's schema requires disease_code to be present. But the text doesn't mention codes, so perhaps I should set disease_code to \"other\" or leave it blank? Wait, the required fields are text, category, and disease_code. So even if the code isn't provided, I have to include it. Maybe \"other\" is the safest choice here. But the user's example had \"measles\" as category and \"other\" as disease_code. Wait, no, in the previous example, the disease_code was missing. Wait, the user's schema says \"required\": [\"text\", \"category\", \"disease_code\"], so all three are required. But the text doesn't mention codes. So perhaps I should use \"other\" for disease_code. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that if no code is given, it's left as an empty string. But the schema requires it. Hmm. Maybe the user expects that for diseases listed without codes, the category is set, and disease_code is \"other\". But I'm not sure. Let me check the example again. In the previous response, the disease entry had \"measles\" as category and \"other\" as disease_code. Wait, no, looking back, the previous example had \"measles\" as category and \"other\" as disease_code? Wait, no, the previous example's disease entry was:\n\n{\n  \"text\": \"measles\",\n  \"category\": \"measles\",\n  \"confidence\": 1.0\n}\n\nWait, but the schema for disease requires disease_code. So maybe the user made a mistake in the example. But since the user provided that example, perhaps they expect that disease_code is optional? Wait, no, the schema says \"required\": [\"text\", \"category\", \"disease_code\"]. So in the previous example, the disease_code was missing. That's conflicting. But the user's current query requires disease_code. So perhaps in this case, for each listed disease, I should set category to the correct enum value and disease_code as \"other\" since no specific code is given. For example, measles would have category \"measles\" and disease_code \"other\". But the user's schema might not have codes for all diseases. Alternatively, maybe the disease_code is not required, but the schema says it is. This is a bit confusing. But given the user's instructions, I have to include disease_code. So for each disease listed, I'll set category to the correct value and disease_code as \"other\".\n\nSo, the diseases listed are cervical cancer, cholera, COVID-19, dengue, diphtheria, Ebola, hepatitis B, influenza, Japanese encephalitis, malaria, measles, meningitis, mpox, mumps, pertussis, pneumonia, polio, rabies, rotavirus, rubella, tetanus, typhoid, varicella, yellow fever. Each of these needs to be mapped to the correct category. For example, \"cervical cancer\" would be \"other\" since it's not in the enum. Wait, the allowed categories for disease are measles, influenza, covid19, pertussis, meningococcal, hepatitis, gastroenteritis, dengue, ross_river_virus, other. So for example, \"cervical cancer\" would be \"other\", \"cholera\" is \"other\", \"malaria\" is \"other\", etc. So each of these diseases not in the enum would be categorized as \"other\". But the user's example had \"measles\" as category and \"other\" as disease_code. Wait, no, in the previous example, the disease_code was missing. But according to the current schema, it's required. So perhaps the user expects that for each disease mentioned, the category is set to the closest match in the enum, and disease_code is \"other\" if not specified. For example, \"measles\" would be category \"measles\" and disease_code \"other\". Similarly, \"influenza\" would be category \"influenza\" and disease_code \"other\". But the user's allowed categories for disease include \"other\", so that's acceptable.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have:\n\n- Temporal: one entry for August 2020, normalized as 2020-08, type date.\n- Spatial: empty array.\n- Event_type: one entry for the Immunization Agenda 2030, category \"surveillance_update\" or \"risk_warning\"? The text says WHO is working to improve vaccination coverage, which is more of a surveillance update. So category \"surveillance_update\".\n- Venue_type: empty array.\n- Disease: each listed disease mapped to \"other\" category, with disease_code \"other\".\n\nWait, but the allowed categories for disease include \"other\", so for diseases not in the enum, they should be categorized as \"other\". For example, \"cervical cancer\" is \"other\", \"cholera\" is \"other\", etc. So each of the listed diseases would have category \"other\" except for those that match the enum. For example, \"measles\" would be category \"measles\", \"influenza\" would be \"influenza\", \"covid19\" would be \"covid19\", \"pertussis\" would be \"pertussis\", \"meningitis\" would be \"meningococcal\"? Wait, the enum has \"meningococcal\" as a category. So \"meningitis\" might be mapped to \"meningococcal\". Similarly, \"hepatitis B\" would be \"hepatitis\". \"Dengue\" is in the enum. \"Malaria\" is \"other\". \"Ebola\" is \"other\". \"Japanese encephalitis\" is \"other\". \"Mumps\" is \"other\". \"Rabies\" is \"other\". \"Rotavirus\" is \"other\". \"Rubella\" is \"other\". \"Tetanus\" is \"other\". \"Typhoid\" is \"other\". \"Varicella\" is \"other\". \"Yellow fever\" is \"other\". \"Diphtheria\" is \"other\". \"Cholera\" is \"other\". \"Cervical cancer\" is \"other\". \"Mpox\" is \"other\". \"Gastroenteritis\" is \"gastroenteritis\". Wait, the enum includes \"gastroenteritis\". So \"gastroenteritis\" would be category \"gastroenteritis\". But the text lists \"gastroenteritis\" as a disease. So that's one entry. Similarly, \"meningitis\" might be mapped to \"meningococcal\" if that's the closest match. But the user's allowed categories for disease include \"meningococcal\", so \"meningitis\" could be mapped to that. However, the exact mapping might be tricky. For example, \"meningitis\" is a different disease from \"meningococcal\", but perhaps the user expects that \"meningitis\" is categorized under \"meningococcal\" if that's the closest match. Alternatively, it's better to categorize as \"other\" if not sure. But given the user's example, they might expect that \"measles\" is mapped to \"measles\", \"influenza\" to \"influenza\", etc. So for the diseases listed, I'll map each to the closest category in the enum, and if not present, use \"other\".\n\nSo, the disease array would have entries for each listed disease, with category as per the enum where possible, and \"other\" otherwise. For example:\n\n- cervical cancer \u2192 other\n- cholera \u2192 other\n- COVID-19 \u2192 covid19\n- dengue \u2192 dengue\n- diphtheria \u2192 other\n- Ebola \u2192 other\n- hepatitis B \u2192 hepatitis\n- influenza \u2192 influenza\n- Japanese encephalitis \u2192 other\n- malaria \u2192 other\n- measles \u2192 measles\n- meningitis \u2192 meningococcal (assuming that's the closest)\n- mpox \u2192 other\n- mumps \u2192 other\n- pertussis \u2192 pertussis\n- pneumonia \u2192 other\n- polio \u2192 other\n- rabies \u2192 other\n- rotavirus \u2192 other\n- rubella \u2192 other\n- tetanus \u2192 other\n- typhoid \u2192 other\n- varicella \u2192 other\n- yellow fever \u2192 other\n\nBut I need to check the allowed categories again. The allowed categories for disease are:\n\nmeasles, influenza, covid19, pertussis, meningococcal, hepatitis, gastroenteritis, dengue, ross_river_virus, other.\n\nSo \"meningitis\" is not in the enum, but \"meningococcal\" is. So perhaps \"meningitis\" is mapped to \"meningococcal\". Similarly, \"gastroenteritis\" is in the enum. So that's one entry. \"Ross_river_virus\" is in the enum. So the text lists \"ross_river_virus\" as a disease, so that would be category \"ross_river_virus\".\n\nSo, compiling all these, the disease array would have entries for each of the listed diseases, with their respective categories. For example:\n\n{\n  \"text\": \"cervical cancer\",\n  \"category\": \"other\",\n  \"disease_code\": \"other\"\n},\n{\n  \"text\": \"cholera\",\n  \"category\": \"other\",\n  \"disease_code\": \"other\"\n},\n{\n  \"text\": \"covid19\",\n  \"category\": \"covid19\",\n  \"disease_code\": \"other\"\n},\n... and so on for each disease.\n\nNow, putting all this into the JSON structure as per the schema.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"August 2020\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2020-08\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"WHO is working with countries and partners to improve global vaccination coverage\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"cervical cancer\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"other\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"cholera\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"other\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"covid19\",\n      \"category\": \"covid19\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"other\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"dengue\",\n      \"category\": \"dengue\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"other\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"diphtheria\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"other\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Ebola\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"other\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"hepatitis B\",\n      \"category\": \"hepatitis\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"other\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"influenza\",\n      \"category\": \"influenza\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"other\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Japanese encephalitis\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"other\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"malaria\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"other\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles\",\n      \"category\": \"measles\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"other\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"meningitis\",\n      \"category\": \"meningococcal\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"other\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"mpox\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"other\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"mumps\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"other\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"pertussis\",\n      \"category\": \"pertussis\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"other\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"pneumonia\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"other\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"polio\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"other\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"rabies\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"other\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"rotavirus\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"other\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"rubella\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"other\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"tetanus\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"other\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"typhoid\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"other\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"varicella\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"other\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"yellow fever\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"other\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

They want me to extract specific data into JSON based on the given schema.\n\nFirst, I need to check for temporal expressions. The text mentions \"6 November 2025\" which is a date. Normalizing that to ISO 8601 would be \"2025-11-06\". The temporal type here is a date.\n\nNext, spatial mentions. The text doesn't have any specific locations like cities or countries. It talks about global stakeholders, but there's no explicit location name. So maybe the spatial array will be empty.\n\nFor event_type, the text discusses strategies, frameworks, and initiatives like the Global Vaccine Action Plan. These seem more like surveillance updates or initiatives rather than specific events. The category \"surveillance_update\" might fit here with a confidence score of 0.8 since it's not a direct event but a strategic document.\n\nVenue_type isn't mentioned here. There's no specific venue like a hospital or clinic, so this array will be empty.\n\nDiseases listed in the text include cholera, cervical cancer, influenza, malaria, measles, poliomyelitis, RSV, rubella, and yellow fever. Each of these should be categorized under their respective disease categories. For example, measles is \"measles\", influenza is \"influenza\", etc. The disease_code isn't provided, so I'll leave that as an empty string unless there's a standard code, but the user didn't specify any, so it's safe to omit or set as empty.\n\nI need to make sure all required fields are present. For event_type, confidence is required, so I'll assign 0.8. For disease, disease_code is required, but since it's not provided, maybe the user expects it to be optional? Wait, looking back at the schema, the required fields for disease include text, category, and disease_code. Oh, but the user's example in the history had disease_code as optional. Wait, no, in the schema provided, the required fields for disease are text, category, and disease_code. But the user's example in the previous interaction didn't include disease_code. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake in the schema. But since the user provided the schema, I have to follow it. However, in the given text, there's no ICD-10 code mentioned, so I'll have to leave disease_code as an empty string.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have temporal with the date, event_type as surveillance_update with confidence, and diseases listed with their categories. Spatial and venue_type will be empty arrays.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"6 November 2025\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2025-11-06\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Implementing the Immunization Agenda 2030: A Framework for Action\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.8\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"cholera\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"cervical cancer\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"influenza\",\n      \"category\": \"influenza\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"malaria\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles\",\n      \"category\": \"measles\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"poliomyelitis\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"rubella\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"yellow fever\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a chunk of text from a document, and I need to extract specific information into JSON based on the given schema. Let me start by reading through the text carefully.\n\nFirst, the text mentions several dates. The latest publication is on 6 November 2025, then 3 November 2025, 2 October 2025, 22 September 2025, and 7 November 2025. These are all dates, so I need to normalize them to ISO 8601 format. Since they're all dates without times, they should be in YYYY-MM-DD format. I'll list each date as a separate temporal entry.\n\nNext, looking for spatial mentions. The text doesn't have any specific locations like cities or countries. The only place mentioned is \"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates\" in the third WLPF report. So I need to extract that as a spatial entry. The location type is city, and the parent region is United Arab Emirates.\n\nFor event_type, the text talks about reports and updates. The \"Departmental update\" and \"report of\" entries might fall under \"surveillance_update\" or \"other\". Since the categories include \"surveillance_update\" and \"other\", I'll check each entry. The WHO report on TB vaccines and the SAGE outcomes might be surveillance updates. However, the user's previous example had \"exposure_site\" but here there's no specific event type mentioned. So maybe \"other\" is the safest choice with confidence 0.5.\n\nVenue_type isn't mentioned here. The text doesn't talk about specific venues like hospitals or clinics, so this array might be empty.\n\nDisease mentions: The text refers to TB vaccines and mentions \"medicines, vaccines and other health products\" but no specific diseases like measles or influenza. So the disease category would be \"other\" with the text as \"TB\" and a disease_code if possible. However, the allowed categories don't include TB, so it's \"other\".\n\nPutting it all together, I need to make sure each array is correctly filled. Temporal has all the dates, spatial has Abu Dhabi, event_type has the reports as \"other\", venue_type is empty, and disease is \"other\" for TB.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"6 November 2025\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2025-11-06\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"3 November 2025\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2025-11-03\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"2 October 2025\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2025-10-02\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"22 September 2025\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2025-09-22\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"7 November 2025\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2025-11-07\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates\",\n      \"location_type\": \"city\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"United Arab Emirates\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Departmental update\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.8\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"report of World Local Production Forum\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.7\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"TB\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"A17.9\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

First, I need to parse the text carefully.\n\nLooking at the text, the first part mentions \"an overview of the third WLPF, held from April 7 to 9, 2024, in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.\" So, the temporal extraction here is the dates April 7 to 9, 2024. Since it's a date range, the temporal_type should be \"interval\". The normalized format would be \"2024-04-07/2024-04-09\". \n\nNext, the spatial part is \"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates\". The location_type is \"city\" and the parent_region is \"United Arab Emirates\". \n\nFor event_type, the text refers to a workshop or meeting (WLPF) organized by WHO. The allowed categories don't include \"workshop\", so the closest is \"other\" with confidence 0.8. \n\nVenue_type isn't mentioned here, so it's an empty array. \n\nDisease isn't mentioned either, so that's also empty. \n\nI need to check if there are other temporal expressions. The rest of the text has dates like 15 October 2025, 30 October 2025, etc., but those are in the document context and not part of the main content. The user's previous example included those, but in this case, the main event is the WLPF. So only the dates from the WLPF are relevant. \n\nDouble-checking the JSON structure to ensure all required fields are present and correct. No other events or diseases are mentioned, so those arrays remain empty. The confidence for event_type is set to 0.8 because \"other\" is a stretch but necessary. \n\nEverything seems to fit. Time to format the JSON accordingly.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"held from April 7 to 9, 2024\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2024-04-07/2024-04-09\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"interval\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates\",\n      \"location_type\": \"city\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"United Arab Emirates\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"overview of the third WLPF\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.8\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": []\n}",

In this 2-part episode of Science in 5, WHO\u2019s Dr. Kate O\u2019Brien breaks down the science behind childhood vaccinations, the importance of the schedule, and the truth behind common concerns.\n\nEpisode #70 - Upcoming new vaccines\n\nWhat are the new vaccines in the pipeline? What are the challenges to turning vaccines into vaccination ? What timelines can we expect for future vaccines? WHO\u2019s Dr Katherine O\u2019Brien explains in Science in 5.\n\nEpisode #67 - Understanding immunity\n\nWHO\u2019s Chief Scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan explains how our body develops immunity against a new virus. How is immunity developed when we are infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus? How is it different from vaccine derived immunity? Why is it important to continue to wear masks, ventilate closed spaces, avoid crowds, wash hands and observe",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a block of text about WHO podcasts and wants me to extract specific information into JSON. First, I need to parse the text carefully.\n\nLooking at the temporal extraction, there's a date mentioned: \"1 May 2025\". That should be normalized to ISO 8601 format, so \"2025-05-01\". The temporal type is a date. \n\nNext, spatial references. The text mentions \"WHO press conference on global health issues\" but doesn't specify a location. Since there's no city or country mentioned, maybe the spatial array is empty here. Wait, the user's previous example had Broome, Western Australia, but this text doesn't have a specific location. So spatial might not have any entries.\n\nFor event_type, the text talks about WHO press conferences and podcasts discussing vaccines. The categories allowed include surveillance_update, vaccination_clinic, etc. Since it's a press conference about health issues, maybe \"surveillance_update\" fits. But the user's previous example had \"exposure_site\" with confidence 1.0. However, here, the event is more about information dissemination, so maybe \"surveillance_update\" with confidence 0.8? Or perhaps \"other\" if none fit. Wait, the allowed categories don't have a direct match for a press conference. The closest might be \"surveillance_update\" if it's about health monitoring. Alternatively, \"other\" with a note. But the user's previous example used \"exposure_site\" even if it wasn't perfect. Maybe here, since it's a press conference on vaccines, it's a \"surveillance_update\" with confidence 0.8.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention a specific venue like a hospital or clinic. The podcasts are part of a series, so maybe the venue is \"community\" or \"other\". But the required fields for venue_type are text, category, and venue_name. Since there's no specific venue mentioned, maybe this array is empty.\n\nDisease: The text discusses vaccines but doesn't mention a specific disease. The categories include \"other\" if none apply. So disease might have an entry with category \"other\" and text \"vaccine safety\".\n\nWait, the user's previous example had \"measles\" as a disease. Here, the text is about vaccines in general, not a specific disease. So disease should be \"other\" with text \"vaccine safety\" or similar. But the allowed categories for disease don't include \"vaccine safety\", so \"other\" is the only option.\n\nPutting it all together: temporal has the date, spatial is empty, event_type is surveillance_update with confidence 0.8, venue_type is empty, and disease is other. Need to check if any other temporal expressions. The phrase \"in times of conflict\" doesn't have a date, so only the 1 May 2025 is relevant. \n\nWait, the user's previous example had \"event_type\" with \"exposure_site\" even though the text didn't mention a site. Maybe here, since the press conference is about health issues, it's a \"surveillance_update\". But the allowed categories don't have that. Wait, looking back, the event_type categories include \"surveillance_update\", so that's valid. So event_type would be \"surveillance_update\" with confidence 0.8. \n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention a venue, so the array is empty. \n\nDisease: No specific disease mentioned, so \"other\" with text \"vaccine safety\" or similar. \n\nSo the final JSON should have temporal with the date, event_type as surveillance_update, disease as other, and others empty.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"1 May 2025\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2025-05-01\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"WHO press conference on global health issues\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.8\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"vaccine safety\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

They want the JSON extraction based on the schema given.\n\nFirst, I need to check for temporal expressions. The text mentions events in February, March, September, and October 2026. Each of these is a date, so I'll normalize them to YYYY-MM-DD. The dates are already in the correct format, so I'll convert them directly.\n\nNext, spatial references. The text doesn't mention any specific locations, so the spatial array will be empty.\n\nFor event_type, the user's question is about why precautions are important. The answer relates to risk warning, so I'll categorize that. The confidence is high, so 1.0.\n\nVenue_type isn't mentioned here, so it's empty. The disease section also isn't directly referenced, so it's empty. But wait, the user's question includes \"different from vaccine derived immunity\" which might relate to diseases. However, the text doesn't specify a disease, so I'll leave it as empty.\n\nI need to make sure all required fields are present. Temporal has the dates, event_type has the risk warning. The rest are empty as there's no relevant data. Let me double-check the schema to ensure compliance. Yes, looks good.

The task is to extract specific data into the required JSON format.\n\nFirst, looking at the temporal extraction. The input text doesn't have any dates, times, or durations. So the temporal array should be empty.\n\nNext, spatial references. The regions listed are Africa, Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, South-East Asia, Western Pacific. These are all regions, so each should be an entry in the spatial array. The location_type is \"region\", and there's no parent region needed since they're already regions. So each region is added with location_type as \"region\".\n\nFor event_type, the text doesn't mention any specific events like outbreaks or case reports. So the event_type array remains empty.\n\nVenue_type is also not mentioned here, so that's empty too.\n\nNow, the diseases listed are Hepatitis, Influenza, Malaria, Measles, Meningitis, Pertussis, Pneumonia, Poliomyelitis, Rabies, Tick-borne encephalitis, Tuberculosis, Typhoid, Yellow fever. Each of these needs to be mapped to the correct category. For example, Hepatitis maps to \"hepatitis\", Influenza to \"influenza\", and so on. The disease_code isn't provided, so it's left as an empty string. Each disease entry should have the text, category, and disease_code.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON will have spatial entries for each region and disease entries for each listed disease. The other fields (temporal, event_type, venue_type) are empty arrays.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Africa\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Americas\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Eastern Mediterranean\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Europe\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"South-East Asia\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Western Pacific\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Hepatitis\",\n      \"category\": \"hepatitis\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Influenza (seasonal)\",\n      \"category\": \"influenza\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Malaria\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Measles\",\n      \"category\": \"measles\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Meningitis\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Pertussis\",\n      \"category\": \"pertussis\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Pneumonia\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Poliomyelitis (polio)\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Rabies\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Tick-borne encephalitis\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Tuberculosis\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Typhoid\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Yellow fever\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

My job is to extract specific information into the required JSON format.\n\nFirst, looking at the temporal extraction. The text mentions \"Measles is no longer endemic in Australia, but cases still occur due to importation by overseas travellers.\" There's no specific date or time mentioned here, so the temporal array might be empty. Wait, but the user's previous example had a date, but this text doesn't have any. So temporal should be an empty array.\n\nNext, spatial. The text refers to \"Victoria\" as a region. So I need to extract that. The location_type would be \"region\" and parent_region is \"Australia\" since Victoria is a state in Australia. So spatial should have an entry for Victoria.\n\nEvent_type: The text talks about public exposure sites, notification requirements, control measures, etc. The category here is \"surveillance_update\" because it's about public health measures and reporting. Confidence is 1.0 since it's directly mentioned.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention specific venues like hospitals or clinics. It's more about general measures, so venue_type might be empty.\n\nDisease: The text repeatedly mentions \"measles\" and the category is \"measles\" with the code \"B05\" (ICD-10 code for measles). So disease array has one entry.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have spatial and event_type filled, others empty. Let me check the schema again to ensure all required fields are there. Temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, disease are all properties, but required is empty, so it's okay if some are missing. But the user's example included all, but maybe some can be empty arrays. So the final JSON should reflect that.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Victoria\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"Australia\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Measles public exposure sites in Victoria\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles\",\n      \"category\": \"measles\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"B05\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Measles must be notified upon initial diagnosis (suspected or confirmed) by medical practitioners and pathology services immediately to the Department of Health by calling 1300 651 160 (24/7) and connecting to the relevant Local Public Health Unit. Pathology services must follow up with written notifications within 5 days. This is a Victorian statutory requirement.\n\nPrimary school and children\u2019s services centres exclusion for measles\n\nChildren with measles must not attend primary school and children\u2019s service centres from symptom onset until at least 4 days after the onset of rash. Exclusion requirements for contacts:\n\nUnimmunised contacts must not attend primary school and children\u2019s service centres for at least 14 days after the onset of rash in the last case of measles. However, they may return if:\n\nvaccinated within 3 days (72 hours) after exposure; OR\n\nthey receive immunoglobulin within 6 days (144 hours) after exposure.\n\nImmunised contacts do not need exclusion.\n\nFor more information, see the School exclusion table.\n\nInfectious agent of measles\n\nMeasles is caused by the measles virus, a member of the genus Morbillivirus in the Paramyxoviridae family.",

I need to extract the required information into the specified JSON format.\n\nFirst, looking at the temporal extraction. The text mentions \"Measles is an 'urgent' notifiable condition.\" But there are no specific dates, times, durations, or intervals here. So the temporal array should be empty.\n\nNext, spatial references. The text talks about Victoria in the notification requirement: \"This is a Victorian statutory requirement.\" So I need to extract \"Victoria\" as a location. The location_type would be \"region\" and parent_region is \"Australia\" since Victoria is a state in Australia. Wait, but the previous document mentioned Victoria, but the user's current context might have different info. Wait, the user's previous spatial references included Victoria, but in this chunk, the text mentions \"Victorian statutory requirement,\" so the location is Victoria, state, parent region Australia. So spatial array should have that.\n\nEvent_type: The text is about notification requirements and exclusion policies. The categories allowed include risk_warning, surveillance_update, etc. Since this is about notifying authorities and guidelines, maybe \"surveillance_update\" or \"risk_warning.\" The text mentions notification requirements and exclusion policies, which could be a risk warning. But the exact category needs to fit. The example in the previous response had \"exposure_site\" but here it's more about guidelines. Maybe \"risk_warning\" with confidence 1.0.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention specific venues like hospitals or clinics. It talks about schools and childcare centers in exclusion policies. But the venue_type categories include school and childcare. However, the text doesn't specify a venue name, so maybe the venue_type isn't applicable here. Wait, the user's schema requires venue_type to be an array, but if there's no mention of a venue, perhaps it's empty. But the previous example had venue_type even if it was a generic one. Wait, the user's example had \"Margaret River Emergency Department\" as a venue. In this case, the text doesn't mention any specific venue, so venue_type array might be empty.\n\nDisease: The text clearly mentions measles, so the category is \"measles\" with confidence 1.0. The disease_code isn't provided, but the schema requires it. Since there's no code, maybe leave it as an empty string or omit? Wait, the required fields for disease include text, category, and disease_code. The user's example had \"measles\" with category and disease_code as empty. Wait, in the previous example, the disease_code was empty. So here, I'll set disease_code to an empty string.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nTemporal: empty array\nSpatial: Victoria as region, parent Australia\nEvent_type: \"notification requirement for measles\" as text, category \"risk_warning\" or \"surveillance_update\". The text is about guidelines, so maybe \"surveillance_update\" with confidence 1.0.\nVenue_type: empty array\nDisease: measles, category measles, disease_code empty.\n\nWait, the user's example had \"event_type\" with \"exposure_site\" but here the text is about notification and exclusion policies. So maybe \"risk_warning\" is more appropriate. Alternatively, \"surveillance_update\" since it's about reporting and guidelines. Let me check the allowed categories again. The allowed categories for event_type include surveillance_update. So \"surveillance_update\" with confidence 1.0.\n\nSo the JSON should have:\n\ntemporal: []\nspatial: [ { \"text\": \"Victoria\", \"location_type\": \"region\", \"parent_region\": \"Australia\" } ]\nevent_type: [ { \"text\": \"Notification requirement for measles\", \"category\": \"surveillance_update\", \"confidence\": 1.0 } ]\nvenue_type: []\ndisease: [ { \"text\": \"measles\", \"category\": \"measles\", \"disease_code\": \"\" } ]\n\nWait, but the user's schema for disease requires disease_code. Since there's no code provided, maybe leave it as an empty string. The previous example had \"disease_code\": \"\".\n\nSo that's the structure. Let me make sure all required fields are present. For event_type, text, category, confidence are required. For disease, text, category, disease_code. All are covered.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Victoria\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"Australia\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Notification requirement for measles\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles\",\n      \"category\": \"measles\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Koplik spots may be seen on the buccal mucosa. Prodromal symptoms usually last 2 to 4 days. The most important clinical predictors are included in the clinical case definition for measles, which is an illness characterised by:\n\ngeneralised maculopapular rash, usually lasting 3 or more days, and\n\nfever (at least 38 \u00b0C if measured) present at the time of rash onset, and\n\ncough or coryza or conjunctivitis or Koplik spots.\n\nThe characteristic rash appears 2 to 7 days after the onset of the prodrome. It begins on the face before becoming generalised and usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Measles infection (confirmed virologically) may rarely occur without a rash. Other symptoms can include anorexia, diarrhoea (especially in infants) and generalised lymphadenopathy. People who have been previously immunised may develop attenuated infection with mild or non-classical clinical features, although this is uncommon. People who are immunocompromised, young children aged below 5 years, pregnant women and adults 20 years of age and older are at increased risk of complications from measles.",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a text about measles and wants me to extract specific information into JSON based on the schema they provided. First, I need to go through each section of the schema and check what's required.\n\nStarting with the temporal extraction. The text given is about measles, its causes, and clinical features. I need to look for any dates, times, durations, or intervals. Scanning through the text, I don't see any explicit dates or times mentioned. The text is more about the disease's characteristics rather than specific temporal data. So, the temporal array might be empty. But wait, the user's previous example had a date, but in this case, there's none. So I'll leave temporal as an empty array.\n\nNext, spatial extraction. The text mentions \"Broome, Western Australia\" in the previous example, but in this current text, there's no location mentioned. The text is about measles in general, not a specific place. So spatial array should also be empty. But wait, the user's previous interaction had Broome, but this text doesn't have any location. So spatial is empty.\n\nEvent type: The text is a general description of measles, not an event. It's more of a case report or surveillance update. The user's schema includes categories like case_report or surveillance_update. Since the text is explaining the disease, maybe it's a surveillance update. But the confidence might be low. However, the text doesn't mention any specific event, so maybe event_type is empty. Wait, the user's previous example had an event_type as exposure_site, but here, the text is just information. So perhaps event_type is empty.\n\nVenue type: The text doesn't mention any venues like hospitals, clinics, etc. So venue_type array is empty.\n\nDisease: The text clearly mentions measles. The category is measles, and the disease_code might be ICD-10 code for measles, which is B05. But the user's schema requires disease_code, which is optional? Wait, looking back, the required fields for disease are text, category, and disease_code. Wait, no, the required array in the schema for disease includes text, category, and disease_code. Wait, checking the schema again: \"required\": [\"text\", \"category\", \"disease_code\"]. So disease_code is required. But the text doesn't provide a code. Hmm, but the user's example in the previous response had \"disease_code\": \"B05\" for measles. So maybe I should include that. But if the text doesn't mention it, maybe I should leave it as empty? Wait, the schema says \"disease_code\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"ICD-10 or SNOMED code if applicable\"}. So it's optional? Wait, no, the required array includes disease_code. Wait, no, looking at the schema again: under \"disease\" properties, \"required\": [\"text\", \"category\", \"disease_code\"]. So all three are required. But the text doesn't mention a code. So maybe I have to infer it. For measles, the ICD-10 code is B05. So I'll include that.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would have empty arrays for temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, and a disease entry with text \"measles\", category \"measles\", and disease_code \"B05\". But wait, the user's previous example had a disease entry with \"measles\" and \"measles\" category, but here the text is about the disease's features, not a specific case. However, the task is to extract disease mentioned, so even if it's general, it's still relevant. So the disease array should have an entry. The other fields are empty. Let me make sure I didn't miss any other mentions. The text says \"Infectious agent of measles\" and \"Measles is caused by...\", so the disease is definitely mentioned. So the final JSON should have the disease entry and others empty.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles\",\n      \"category\": \"measles\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"B05\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Complications can include otitis media, pneumonia and encephalitis, which occurs in about one in every 1,000 infected people. Measles infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, premature labour and low birth weight infants. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is an extremely rare and delayed complication of measles, occurring in about one per 100,000 cases. SSPE usually begins about 7 years after the measles infection. It is characterised by progressive inflammation and degeneration of the brain and is always fatal.\n\nManagement of suspected cases\n\nPeople with symptoms of measles are advised to seek medical care, call ahead to the doctor or health facility and wear a mask when leaving the home. On arrival to the health facility, they should be identified and immediately diverted to a separate room for assessment under airborne precautions. Suspected cases should isolate at home until they\u2019ve been advised whether or not they are a confirmed case of measles. Suspected cases should not go to work, school or public places (e.g. supermarkets).\n\nDiagnosis\n\nLocal Public Health Units (LPHUs) can provide advice on recommended testing for measles at the point of notification of suspected cases by medical practitioners which can include:\n\nserology (demonstration of measles IgM antibody)",

The user provided a text about measles complications and management, and they want the JSON extraction based on the specified schema.\n\nFirst, I need to check for temporal expressions. The text mentions \"7 years after the measles infection,\" which is a duration. So, I'll normalize that to \"P7Y\" as a duration. There are no specific dates or times mentioned, so only the duration is extracted.\n\nNext, spatial references. The text doesn't mention any specific locations like cities or regions. The previous context had Broome, Western Australia, but this text is about general measles information. So, spatial extraction might be empty here.\n\nFor event_type, the text discusses complications and management of measles, which could be a risk_warning since it's informing about risks. The confidence is high, so 1.0.\n\nVenue_type isn't mentioned here. The text talks about medical advice but doesn't specify a venue. So, this array might be empty.\n\nDisease is clearly measles, so the category is measles. The text mentions SSPE, but that's a complication, not a separate disease. So, the disease entry is measles with category measles and code as per ICD-10, which is B05 for measles. Wait, the schema requires disease_code, but the user didn't provide codes. Maybe leave it as empty or use a placeholder. But the example in the previous response had \"measles\" as category and code as \"measles\". Wait, the schema says disease_code is ICD-10 or SNOMED. So, for measles, the ICD-10 code is B05. So, I'll use that.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have temporal with the duration, event_type as risk_warning, disease as measles with code B05. Spatial and venue_type are empty arrays. Let me double-check the schema requirements. All required fields are covered. No other diseases mentioned. Okay, that should be it.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"7 years after the measles infection\",\n      \"normalized\": \"P7Y\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"duration\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Measles infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, premature labour and low birth weight infants\",\n      \"category\": \"risk_warning\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles\",\n      \"category\": \"measles\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"B05\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a text about measles testing protocols and wants the JSON extraction as per the schema. First, I need to parse the text for temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, and disease categories.\n\nStarting with temporal expressions. The text mentions \"Up to 3 weeks since onset of rash\" and \"3 days or less after rash onset\". These are durations. The user's previous example normalized \"March 15, 2022\" to a date, but here there are no specific dates. The instruction says for dates without years, use the most recent year in the document context. However, the current document context's publication date is unknown. But since there's no specific date mentioned, maybe there are no temporal entries. Wait, the text also says \"3 days or less after rash onset\" and \"4 to 14 days after rash onset\". These are durations. So I should normalize those as P3D and P14D. But the user's previous example had a date, but here there's no date, just durations. So temporal entries would be those durations.\n\nNext, spatial. The text mentions \"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory (VIDRL)\" which is in Victoria, Australia. So the location is \"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory\" with parent region \"Victoria, Australia\". Wait, the previous spatial references had Victoria, but here it's VIDRL. So the location_type would be 'venue' or 'feature'? The schema allows 'venue' as a location_type. So spatial entry would be text: \"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory\", location_type: 'venue', parent_region: 'Victoria, Australia'.\n\nEvent_type: The text is about testing procedures for measles, which is a case report or surveillance update. The user's previous example had 'exposure_site', but here it's more about diagnostic testing. The allowed categories include 'case_report' or 'surveillance_update'. Since it's about testing and diagnosis, maybe 'case_report' or 'surveillance_update'. The text says \"suspected cases by medical practitioners\" which might be case reports. So event_type could be 'case_report' with confidence 1.0.\n\nVenue_type: The text mentions VIDRL, which is a laboratory. The venue_type categories include 'other' since there's no specific category for a lab. So venue_type would be category 'other' with venue_name 'Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory'.\n\nDisease: The text clearly mentions measles, so category 'measles' with disease_code if available. The user's previous example used 'measles' with code 'B05' (ICD-10 for measles). But the user didn't specify codes, so maybe just the category. Wait, the schema requires disease_code. Since the user didn't provide codes, perhaps leave it as empty or use 'B05' as a default. But the user's previous example had 'measles' with code 'B05', so maybe follow that. However, the current text doesn't mention codes, so maybe the disease_code is empty. Wait, the schema requires disease_code, so I need to include it. But since the user hasn't provided codes, perhaps use 'B05' as the ICD-10 code for measles. Alternatively, if unsure, leave it as empty. But the example in the previous response had 'measles' with code 'B05', so maybe that's acceptable here.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nTemporal entries: durations P3D and P14D from the text. The text mentions \"3 days or less after rash onset\" \u2192 P3D, and \"4 to 14 days after rash onset\" \u2192 P14D. So two temporal entries.\n\nSpatial: VIDRL as a venue in Victoria.\n\nEvent_type: case_report with confidence 1.0.\n\nVenue_type: other, venue_name VIDRL.\n\nDisease: measles, code B05.\n\nWait, but the user's previous example had 'exposure_site' and 'hospital_emergency' but here the venue is a lab. So venue_type should be 'other' since there's no specific category for a lab. The allowed categories include 'other'.\n\nSo the JSON should have these elements. Let me check the schema again to ensure all required fields are present. For example, in venue_type, the required fields are text, category, venue_name. So each venue_type entry must have those. Similarly, disease requires text, category, disease_code. So for disease, even if code isn't specified, it's required. So I'll use 'B05' as the code for measles.\n\nNow, compiling all into the JSON structure as per the schema.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"3 days or less after rash onset\",\n      \"normalized\": \"P3D\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"duration\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"4 to 14 days after rash onset\",\n      \"normalized\": \"P14D\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"duration\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory\",\n      \"location_type\": \"venue\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"Victoria, Australia\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"testing for measles in suspected cases\",\n      \"category\": \"case_report\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles\",\n      \"category\": \"measles\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"B05\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

It is usually 14 days until the rash appears. The incubation period can be longer if immunoglobulin is given early in the incubation period.\n\nReservoir of measles virus\n\nHumans.\n\nMode of transmission of measles virus\n\nMeasles is mainly transmitted by airborne droplets and direct contact with respiratory secretions and contaminated surfaces and objects.\n\nThe virus can survive in the environment for up to 2 hours, allowing for transmission in the absence of direct contact with an infectious case. Transmission has been reported in people whose only apparent source of infection was a room previously occupied by a patient with measles.\n\nPeriod of communicability of measles\n\nCases are infectious 24 hours prior to the onset of prodromal symptoms until 4 days after the onset of the rash. Where the prodrome is undefined, the onset of the infectious period should be considered to be 4 days before the onset of the rash.",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a block of text related to measles testing and transmission. My task is to extract temporal, spatial, event type, venue type, and disease information in JSON format.\n\nFirst, looking at the temporal expressions. The text mentions \"onset of rash\" and various time frames like \"up to 3 weeks since onset of rash\" and \"after 3 weeks since onset of rash\". The previous temporal references mention durations like P3D and P14D. Since the user's previous example used \"P3D\" for 3 days or less, I should normalize \"3 weeks\" to P21D. Also, \"onset of rash\" is a relative term, so I need to check if there's a specific date mentioned. But in this text, there's no absolute date, so I'll use the relative durations as given.\n\nNext, spatial references. The text doesn't mention any specific locations like cities or regions. The previous context had Victoria, but this text doesn't have any spatial mentions. So the spatial array might be empty.\n\nFor event_type, the text discusses recommended testing and transmission details. The categories include surveillance_update or risk_warning. Since it's providing information on testing and transmission, \"surveillance_update\" seems appropriate with high confidence.\n\nVenue_type isn't mentioned here. The text doesn't talk about specific venues like hospitals or clinics, so this array will be empty.\n\nDisease is clearly measles, so the category is measles with the code as per the allowed categories. The text mentions measles multiple times, so that's straightforward.\n\nI need to make sure all JSON fields are correctly formatted. Temporal entries should have normalized durations. Check if \"3 weeks\" is P21D. Yes, since 3 weeks is 21 days. The event_type is surveillance_update with confidence 1.0. Disease code for measles is likely B05 (ICD-10 code). \n\nNo spatial or venue entries, so those arrays are empty. Double-check the required fields for each object to ensure they're present. All looks good. Now, structure the JSON accordingly.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"on time since onset of rash\",\n      \"normalized\": \"P0D\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"duration\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Up to 3 weeks since onset of rash\",\n      \"normalized\": \"P21D\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"duration\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"After 3 weeks since onset of rash\",\n      \"normalized\": \"P21D\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"duration\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Recommended testing for measles based on time since onset of rash\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles\",\n      \"category\": \"measles\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"B05\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The first dose of measles-containing vaccine given at 12 months of age produces protective antibodies in approximately 95 per cent of infants and the second dose given at 18 months of age increases protection to approximately 99 per cent of infants.\n\nNatural infection provides lifelong immunity. Evidence of previous measles infection can be confirmed on prior diagnostic laboratory testing or through serological testing. Self-reported history of measles infection is often unreliable. Therefore serological confirmation is recommended before deferring vaccination based on presumed past infection, as most clinically reported cases subsequently test negative.\n\nPublic health significance and occurrence of measles\n\nGlobally, the introduction of measles-containing vaccines in infant immunisation programs has led to a significant reduction in measles cases, associated morbidity and deaths.",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a text about measles and asked for JSON extraction based on specific tasks. First, I need to check for temporal expressions. The text mentions \"4 days before the onset of the rash.\" But there's no specific date given. The previous temporal references mention things like P3D for 3 days after rash onset. However, since there's no actual date here, maybe there's nothing to extract here. Wait, the user's previous example had a date, but this text doesn't have any dates. So temporal might be empty.\n\nNext, spatial references. The text doesn't mention any locations like cities or regions. The previous mentions were Broome and Victoria, but this text is about measles in general. So spatial might also be empty.\n\nEvent type: The text discusses susceptibility, vaccination, and public health significance. None of the event categories like case report or outbreak alert apply here. It's more of a general information piece, so maybe \"surveillance_update\" or \"other\"? The user's previous example had \"exposure_site\" but this doesn't fit. So event_type could be \"other\" with low confidence.\n\nVenue type: There's no mention of venues like hospitals or clinics here. So venue_type is empty.\n\nDisease: The text is about measles, so the category is \"measles\" with confidence 1.0. The disease_code could be ICD-10 code for measles, which is B05. But the user didn't specify codes, so maybe leave it as empty or use \"other\" if not sure. Wait, the schema requires disease_code, but the example in the previous response didn't include it. Hmm, maybe it's optional? Wait, looking back, the required fields for disease are text, category, and disease_code. So I need to include disease_code. Since measles is B05, I'll use that.\n\nPutting it all together: temporal is empty, spatial is empty, event_type is \"other\" with confidence 0.5, venue_type is empty, and disease is measles with code B05. Let me check the schema again to make sure. Yes, that seems right.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"People are at increased risk of measles infection following exposure if they are not fully immunised or do not have immunity from previous measles infection.\",\n      \"category\": \"risk_warning\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.8\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles\",\n      \"category\": \"measles\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"B05\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

In addition to providing direct protection to the vaccine recipient, immunisation against measles results in the indirect protection of unimmunised people (herd immunity) if high enough coverage is achieved in the population. Vaccination has several major effects on measles epidemiology, including an increase of the mean age of infection and an increase in the time between epidemics. Endemic transmission of measles ceased in Australia by the late 1990s as a result of the two-dose vaccination schedule and widespread vaccination. In 2014 the World Health Organization verified that Australia had achieved elimination status for measles, defined as the absence of endemic transmission in a defined geographical area for \u2265 12months. Although measles is no longer endemic in Australia, there continues to be imported cases in overseas visitors and returning residents, with occasional onwards local transmission.\n\nInterruptions to global vaccination programs during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the resumption of international travel post-pandemic, have led to an increase in measles cases worldwide, heightening the risk of importation to Australia.\n\nControl measures for measles\n\nPreventive measures\n\nMeasles-containing vaccines are live attenuated vaccines.",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a text about measles vaccination and control measures. They want me to extract specific information into JSON based on the schema they provided.\n\nFirst, I need to look for temporal expressions. The text mentions \"late 1990s\" and \"2014\". The late 1990s is a bit vague, but since there's no specific date, I'll normalize it to the latest possible year, which would be 1999. The year 2014 is a specific date, so that's straightforward. The temporal_type for \"late 1990s\" could be a date range, but the schema doesn't have an interval type. Wait, the enum for temporal_type includes interval, which is start/end. But the text says \"end of 1990s\" as a single point. Maybe it's better to treat it as a date. However, the user's previous example normalized \"late 1990s\" as a date. Let me check the previous example again. Oh, in the first example, \"late 1990s\" was normalized to a date. So I'll do the same here. So \"late 1990s\" becomes 1999-12-31, and \"2014\" is 2014-01-01. Wait, but the text says \"the late 1990s\" as a period, but the user's previous example normalized it to a date. Maybe the user expects that. So I'll go with that.\n\nNext, spatial mentions. The text mentions \"Australia\" and \"overseas visitors and returning residents\". Australia is a country, so location_type is country. The \"overseas visitors\" might be a region, but since it's not a specific place, maybe \"other\". But the parent_region for Australia is not specified, but the user's previous example had parent_region as Western Australia. Wait, in the first example, the location was Broome, Western Australia. So for Australia, the parent_region might be the country, but since Australia is a country, maybe parent_region is not needed. Wait, the schema for spatial requires location_type and parent_region. Wait, no, the required fields are text and location_type. Parent_region is optional. So for \"Australia\", location_type is country, and parent_region is not needed. But the user's previous example had parent_region for Western Australia. So maybe for Australia, since it's a country, parent_region is not applicable. So I'll just include \"Australia\" as country.\n\nEvent_type: The text talks about measles vaccination programs, which is a surveillance update or a vaccination clinic. The event_type categories include vaccination_clinic. The text mentions \"infant immunisation programs\" and \"vaccination schedule\", so maybe the event_type is vaccination_clinic. But the text is more about the effects of vaccination rather than a specific event. Alternatively, it could be a surveillance_update. But the user's previous example had \"exposure_site\" for a cyclone. Wait, the user's first example had a cyclone hitting Broome, which was categorized as exposure_site. But in this case, the text is about vaccination programs. The event_type categories include vaccination_clinic. So maybe the event_type is vaccination_clinic. But the text is more about the impact of vaccination, not a specific event. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a surveillance_update. But the user's example had \"exposure_site\" for a cyclone. Maybe the event_type here is \"surveillance_update\" because it's discussing the status of measles cases and vaccination programs. But I'm not sure. The user's previous example had \"exposure_site\" for a cyclone, but that might be a stretch. Alternatively, maybe the event_type is \"other\". But the user's schema allows \"other\". However, the text is about vaccination programs leading to reduction in cases, so maybe it's a surveillance_update. But I'm not certain. Let me check the allowed categories again: exposure_site, case_report, outbreak_alert, risk_warning, surveillance_update, vaccination_clinic, other. Since the text is about vaccination programs and their effects, maybe \"surveillance_update\" is the best fit. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe \"vaccination_clinic\" if it's about the clinics. But the text is more about the program's impact. Maybe \"surveillance_update\" is better. I'll go with that.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention specific venues like hospitals or clinics. It talks about vaccination programs in general, so venue_type might not be applicable. But the schema requires it. Wait, the user's previous example had venue_type as hospital_emergency. But in this text, there's no mention of a specific venue. So maybe venue_type is empty. But the schema requires it. Wait, no, the required fields for venue_type are text, category, venue_name. But if there's no venue mentioned, then maybe it's not included. However, the user's previous example included venue_type even if it was a specific place. In this case, since there's no venue mentioned, perhaps venue_type is not present. But the user's schema allows for it. Wait, the user's schema for venue_type is an array, so if there are no venues, the array is empty. So I'll leave venue_type as an empty array.\n\nDisease: The text mentions measles multiple times. So the category is measles, and the disease_code could be ICD-10 code for measles, which is B05. But the user's previous example didn't include disease_code, so maybe it's optional. The schema requires disease_code, but the user's example didn't have it. Wait, looking back, the user's first example had \"disease\": [{\"text\": \"measles\", \"category\": \"measles\", \"confidence\": 1.0}]. But the schema for disease requires disease_code. Wait, the user's schema for disease has required fields: text, category, disease_code. But in the first example, the user didn't include disease_code. That's conflicting. Wait, the user's initial instruction said to return only JSON, but the schema provided here requires disease_code. So maybe the user made a mistake in the schema. But I have to follow the schema. So for disease, I need to include disease_code. The ICD-10 code for measles is B05. So I'll include that.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nTemporal: two entries, \"late 1990s\" normalized to 1999-12-31 (date), and \"2014\" as 2014-01-01 (date).\n\nSpatial: Australia as country.\n\nEvent_type: surveillance_update with confidence 1.0.\n\nVenue_type: empty array.\n\nDisease: measles with code B05.\n\nWait, but the text mentions \"measles-containing vaccines\", so the disease is measles. So the disease entry is correct.\n\nNow, checking the schema again. The user's schema for event_type requires text, category, confidence. The text should be the original text mentioning the event. The text here is about vaccination programs leading to reduction in cases, so the event_type could be \"surveillance_update\". The confidence is 1.0.\n\nSo the final JSON should have these elements.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"late 1990s\",\n      \"normalized\": \"1999-12-31\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"2014\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2014-01-01\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Australia\",\n      \"location_type\": \"country\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles-containing vaccines in infant immunisation programs has led to a significant reduction in measles cases\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles\",\n      \"category\": \"measles\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"B05\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a document about measles control measures and vaccination in Australia. I need to extract temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, and disease information.\n\nFirst, looking for temporal expressions. The text mentions \"infants aged 12 months (MMR) and 18 months (MMRV)\" but no specific dates. Since there are no explicit dates, I should check the previous temporal references. The previous chunk had a date in 2022, but this document doesn't mention any specific dates. So maybe there are no temporal expressions here. Wait, the user's previous example had a date, but this text doesn't have any. So temporal array might be empty.\n\nNext, spatial mentions. The text refers to \"Australia\" and \"Victorian Government funded program\". So \"Australia\" is a country, and \"Victoria\" is a state in Australia. So spatial entries would be Australia as country, and Victoria as region with parent region Australia.\n\nEvent_type: The document talks about vaccination programs, which is a surveillance_update or vaccination_clinic? The text mentions control measures, preventive measures, vaccination eligibility. Maybe \"surveillance_update\" or \"vaccination_clinic\". But the allowed categories include \"vaccination_clinic\" and \"surveillance_update\". Since it's about vaccination programs and recommendations, maybe \"surveillance_update\" with confidence 0.8 or so. Alternatively, \"vaccination_clinic\" if it's about clinics. But the text is more about guidelines, so surveillance_update might be better.\n\nVenue_type: The text mentions \"National Immunisation Program\" and \"Victorian Government funded program\", but no specific venues like hospitals or clinics. So maybe no venue_type entries here.\n\nDisease: The text clearly mentions measles, so category is measles with confidence 1.0.\n\nSo putting it all together. Temporal is empty. Spatial has Australia and Victoria. Event_type is surveillance_update. Venue_type none. Disease is measles.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Australia\",\n      \"location_type\": \"country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Victoria\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"Australia\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Control measures for measles\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.8\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles\",\n      \"category\": \"measles\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"B05\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a text about measles vaccination guidelines and wants the JSON extraction as per the schema. First, I need to parse the text for temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, and disease categories.\n\nStarting with temporal expressions. The text mentions \"born during or after 1966\" which is a relative date. Using the previous temporal references, the most recent year in the document context is 2022 (from the previous example). So, \"born during or after 1966\" would normalize to 1966-01-01. But wait, the user's previous example had a date in 2022, but here the text doesn't have a specific date. The mention of \"1966\" is a year, so the normalized date would be 1966-01-01. However, the temporal_type here is a date. But the text says \"born during or after 1966,\" which is a range. But the schema requires temporal_type to be one of the specified enums. Since the user's previous example used \"date\" for a specific date, maybe here it's a date range. But the schema doesn't have an interval type. Wait, the temporal_type options are date, time, datetime, duration, interval. The text says \"born during or after 1966,\" which is a start date, but without an end. Maybe it's considered a date. Alternatively, maybe there's no temporal expression here. Wait, the text doesn't have explicit dates like \"March 15, 2022\" but mentions \"1966\" as a year. So the temporal extraction would be \"born during or after 1966\" normalized to 1966-01-01, but the temporal_type would be date. However, the exact wording is a range, but the schema might not handle intervals. Maybe the user expects just the year as a date. So I'll include that.\n\nNext, spatial. The text doesn't mention any specific locations like cities or regions. The previous examples had locations like Broome, Western Australia, but this text doesn't have any spatial mentions. So the spatial array would be empty.\n\nEvent_type: The text discusses vaccination guidelines, which could be a surveillance_update or a risk_warning. The mention of outbreaks and recommendations might fit into a risk_warning. The text says \"in a local outbreak,\" so maybe an outbreak_alert. But the main content is about vaccination guidelines, so perhaps surveillance_update. However, the user's previous example had \"exposure_site\" for a cyclone. Here, the event is about vaccination, so maybe \"surveillance_update\" or \"risk_warning\". The text mentions \"local outbreak\" and recommendations, so \"risk_warning\" might be appropriate. Confidence is 1.0.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention any specific venues like hospitals or clinics. The previous example had a hospital_emergency, but this text doesn't have that. So venue_type array is empty.\n\nDisease: The text clearly mentions measles, so the category is measles. The text says \"measles-containing vaccine,\" so the disease is measles. The disease_code could be B05 (ICD-10 code for measles). Confidence is 1.0.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have temporal with the 1966 date, event_type as risk_warning, disease as measles. The other fields (spatial, venue_type) are empty. Let me check the schema again to ensure all required fields are met. The temporal requires text, normalized, temporal_type. The event_type needs text, category, confidence. Disease needs text, category, disease_code. The other fields are optional. So the final JSON should include those elements.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"born during or after 1966\",\n      \"normalized\": \"1966-01-01\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles-containing vaccines are contraindicated in pregnant women\",\n      \"category\": \"risk_warning\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"unimmunised healthcare workers... at high risk of measles infection\",\n      \"category\": \"risk_warning\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles\",\n      \"category\": \"measles\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"B05\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The measles vaccination status of all healthcare workers should be assessed before they commence work, and non-immune workers should be vaccinated with 2 doses of MMR vaccine. For further guidance refer to the Australian immunisation Handbook - Measles.\n\nHow to access the vaccine\n\nMMR vaccine is widely available through GPs, community pharmacies, Aboriginal Health Services and local councils.\n\nImmunisation providers can order MMR vaccine through their government vaccine account via Onelink online.\n\nControl of case\n\nThere is no specific treatment for measles. Treatment is supportive or aimed at managing complications of measles. When seeking medical care, suspected or confirmed cases of measles should call ahead to the doctor or health facility and wear a mask when leaving the home. On arrival to the health facility, they should be identified and immediately diverted to a separate room for assessment under airborne precautions. If unable to put in respiratory isolation, the case should be managed in a single room with a closed door. Cases who are hospitalised should be isolated and cared for under airborne precautions, ideally in a room with negative pressure ventilation, until they are no longer infectious.",

They want the information extracted into specific JSON fields. \n\nFirst, I need to check for temporal expressions. The text mentions \"born during or after 1966\" which is a relative date. According to the previous references, \"born during or after 1966\" should be normalized to 1966-01-01. So that's a date.\n\nNext, spatial references. The text mentions \"Australia\" and \"Aboriginal Health Services\" but the main location here is Australia. The parent region for Australia is itself, so I'll note that. Also, \"Aboriginal Health Services\" might be a venue, but the user's spatial extraction is for locations, so maybe just Australia as the main spatial entry.\n\nFor event_type, the text talks about healthcare workers at risk and vaccination guidelines. This seems like a risk warning because it's advising on measures to prevent measles. The confidence is high, so 1.0.\n\nVenue_type includes places like GPs, pharmacies, etc. These are clinics and pharmacies. So \"GP\" would be clinic_gp, and \"pharmacy\" is pharmacy. The venue names would be the general terms like \"GPs\" and \"community pharmacies\".\n\nDisease is clearly measles, so category is measles with the code as per the enum. The text mentions MMR vaccine, but the disease is measles.\n\nI need to make sure all required fields are present. Temporal has the date, spatial has Australia, event_type is risk_warning, venue_type includes clinic_gp and pharmacy, and disease is measles. Check the JSON schema to ensure all required properties are there. No other events or diseases mentioned, so the arrays should have those entries. Double-check the normalization and categories against the provided enums. Looks good.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"born during or after 1966\",\n      \"normalized\": \"1966-01-01\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Australia\",\n      \"location_type\": \"country\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"Australia\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"healthcare workers at high risk of measles infection\",\n      \"category\": \"risk_warning\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"GPs\",\n      \"category\": \"clinic_gp\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"General Practitioners\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"community pharmacies\",\n      \"category\": \"pharmacy\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"Community Pharmacies\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles\",\n      \"category\": \"measles\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"B05\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a text about measles control measures and wants the information extracted into specific JSON fields. First, I need to parse the text for temporal expressions. The text mentions \"until 4 days after the onset of rash.\" Since there's no specific date given, I should check the previous temporal references. The last mentioned date was March 15, 2022, but that's from a previous context. However, the current text doesn't have a date, so maybe I should note that there are no temporal expressions here. Wait, the user's previous example had a date, but in this case, the text doesn't mention any dates. So the temporal array might be empty.\n\nNext, spatial references. The text doesn't mention any specific locations like cities or regions. The previous spatial references included Victoria and Western Australia, but this text doesn't add new locations. So the spatial array might also be empty.\n\nFor event_type, the text discusses measures for measles cases, like isolation and contact tracing. This seems like a surveillance update or a risk warning. The category could be \"surveillance_update\" or \"risk_warning.\" The confidence is high, so 1.0.\n\nVenue_type isn't mentioned here. The text talks about public places but doesn't specify venues like hospitals or schools. So venue_type might be empty.\n\nDisease is clearly measles, so the category is \"measles\" with the text \"measles\" and a disease_code. Since there's no code provided, maybe leave it as an empty string or use \"B01\" which is the ICD-10 code for measles. But the user's previous example used \"measles\" without a code. Let me check the schema again. The disease_code is optional? Wait, the required fields include text, category, and disease_code. Oh, the schema says \"required\": [\"text\", \"category\", \"disease_code\"], so I need to include disease_code. But the text doesn't mention a code. Maybe use \"B01\" as the ICD-10 code for measles. Alternatively, if unsure, leave it as an empty string. But the user's previous example had \"measles\" with category and no code. Hmm, maybe the disease_code is optional? Wait, looking back at the schema, the required fields for disease include text, category, and disease_code. So I have to include disease_code. Since the text doesn't specify, perhaps use \"B01\" as the standard code. Alternatively, if the user expects it to be omitted, but the schema requires it. Maybe the user expects the code to be present. Let me check the previous example. In the first response, the disease entry had \"measles\" as text, category \"measles\", and disease_code as empty. Wait, no, in the first example, the disease_code was present but empty? Wait, no, looking back, the first example's disease entry had \"disease_code\": \"\"? Wait, no, the first example's disease entry was:\n\n\"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles\",\n      \"category\": \"measles\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ]\n\nWait, but the schema for disease requires disease_code. So maybe the user made a mistake in the first example. But the current task requires disease_code. So perhaps in this case, since the text doesn't mention a code, I should leave it as an empty string. But the schema says required, so maybe it's mandatory. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me proceed with the information given. The text mentions measles, so category is measles, text is measles, and disease_code is empty or \"B01\". Since the user's previous example didn't include disease_code, maybe it's optional. Wait, the schema says \"required\": [\"text\", \"category\", \"disease_code\"], so it's required. Therefore, I need to include it. Since the text doesn't specify, perhaps use \"B01\" as the ICD-10 code for measles. Alternatively, if the user expects it to be omitted, but the schema requires it, maybe the code is not provided. But the user might have made an error in the schema. To comply with the schema, I'll include disease_code as \"B01\".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would have empty arrays for temporal, spatial, venue_type, and event_type with \"surveillance_update\" or \"risk_warning\". Let me check the event_type categories. The text is about measures to control measles, which could be a surveillance update or a risk warning. \"Surveillance_update\" might be more appropriate here. So event_type category is \"surveillance_update\" with confidence 1.0.\n\nSo the final JSON would have:\n\ntemporal: empty array\nspatial: empty array\nevent_type: [ { \"text\": \"...\", \"category\": \"surveillance_update\", \"confidence\": 1.0 } ]\nvenue_type: empty array\ndisease: [ { \"text\": \"measles\", \"category\": \"measles\", \"disease_code\": \"B01\" } ]\n\nWait, but the user's previous example had \"measles\" in the disease array without a code. Maybe the disease_code is optional. But according to the schema, it's required. So I need to include it. Let me proceed with \"B01\".\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"People with measles should isolate at home until they are no longer infectious, usually until 4 days after the onset of rash\",\n      \"category\": \"risk_warning\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"LPHUs investigate all suspected cases of measles to confirm the diagnosis and follow up confirmed cases\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles\",\n      \"category\": \"measles\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"B01\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a text about post-exposure prophylaxis recommendations and contact tracing. They want the information extracted into specific JSON fields.\n\nFirst, looking at the temporal extraction. The text mentions \"up to 30 minutes after the case left.\" That's a duration. So I need to normalize that to ISO 8601. The duration here is P0.5H since 30 minutes is half an hour. But wait, the example in the previous interaction used P1D for a day. So maybe P0.5H is correct. But I should check if the system expects durations in whole numbers. Alternatively, maybe it's better to represent it as P30M. The user's previous example had \"After 3 weeks since onset of rash \u2192 P21D\", so weeks are converted to days. So 30 minutes would be P0.5H or P30M. The schema allows durations, so I'll go with P30M.\n\nNext, spatial references. The text mentions \"healthcare institutions, such as medical practices or emergency departments.\" These are venues, but the spatial extraction is for locations. The example in the previous response had \"Broome, Western Australia\" as a city with parent region. Here, the locations mentioned are medical practices, emergency departments, hospitals, boarding schools, etc. But the user's spatial extraction requires location types like city, country, etc. However, the text doesn't specify actual places like cities or countries, just types of venues. So maybe there's no spatial data here. Wait, the user's previous example included \"Margaret River Emergency Department\" as a venue, but in this case, the text doesn't mention specific locations. So spatial might be empty.\n\nEvent type: The text is about contact tracing and post-exposure prophylaxis. The event type could be \"risk_warning\" or \"surveillance_update\" since it's about managing contacts and prophylaxis. The previous example had \"exposure_site\" for a cyclone, but here it's more about managing contacts after an exposure. So maybe \"risk_warning\" with confidence 1.0.\n\nVenue type: The text mentions healthcare institutions like emergency departments, medical practices, schools, etc. So the venue types would be \"hospital_emergency\" for emergency departments, \"school\" for educational settings, \"childcare\" for childcare, \"workplace\" for work colleagues. Each of these would be in the venue_type array with their respective categories and names. For example, \"emergency departments\" as hospital_emergency, \"school\" as school, etc.\n\nDisease: The text doesn't mention a specific disease. The previous example had measles, but here it's about general contacts. So the disease category would be \"other\" with the text as \"post-exposure prophylaxis\" or maybe \"other\" since no specific disease is named. Wait, the user's previous response had \"measles\" as the disease, but in this case, the text doesn't specify a disease. So the disease field would be \"other\" with the text being \"post-exposure prophylaxis\" or maybe \"other\" with no specific text. But the schema requires \"text\" and \"category\". Since the text doesn't mention a specific disease, the category would be \"other\" and the text could be \"post-exposure prophylaxis\" or just \"other\". But the user's previous example had \"measles\" as the text. Here, since no disease is mentioned, maybe the disease field is empty. Wait, the schema requires \"text\" and \"category\" for disease. So if there's no specific disease, perhaps the category is \"other\" and the text is \"post-exposure prophylaxis\" or \"other\". But the user's previous example had \"measles\" as the text. So maybe in this case, since no disease is mentioned, the disease array is empty. But the user's instruction says to extract disease if mentioned. Since the text doesn't mention a specific disease, the disease field would be empty. However, the user's previous example included \"measles\" even though it wasn't in the text. Wait, no, in the previous example, the user's input was about a cyclone, but the assistant added \"measles\" as a disease. That seems incorrect. Wait, looking back, the user's first input was about a cyclone, and the assistant's response included \"measles\" as a disease, which doesn't make sense. That might be an error. But the user's current input doesn't mention a disease. So the disease array should be empty. But the schema requires \"text\" and \"category\". So perhaps the disease is \"other\" with text \"post-exposure prophylaxis\" or something else. Alternatively, maybe the disease is not present. But the schema requires the fields. So maybe the disease is \"other\" with text \"post-exposure prophylaxis\" and category \"other\". But that's not accurate. Alternatively, the disease array is empty. However, the schema doesn't have a \"required\" field for disease, so it's allowed to be empty. So in this case, the disease array would be empty.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nTemporal: The only temporal mention is \"up to 30 minutes after the case left\" which is a duration of P30M.\n\nSpatial: No specific locations mentioned, so empty.\n\nEvent_type: The text is about managing contacts and prophylaxis, which could be a \"risk_warning\" or \"surveillance_update\". The previous example used \"exposure_site\", but here it's more about managing contacts. So \"risk_warning\" with confidence 1.0.\n\nVenue_type: The text mentions healthcare institutions (emergency departments, medical practices), schools, childcare, workplaces. So entries for hospital_emergency, school, childcare, workplace.\n\nDisease: No specific disease mentioned, so empty.\n\nWait, but the user's previous example had \"measles\" even though it wasn't in the text. Maybe the assistant made a mistake. But in this case, the text doesn't mention any disease, so the disease array should be empty. However, the schema requires \"text\" and \"category\" for each disease entry. So if there's no disease, the array is empty. So the final JSON would have temporal with P30M, event_type as risk_warning, venue_type entries for the mentioned venues, and disease array empty.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"up to 30 minutes after the case left\",\n      \"normalized\": \"P30M\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"duration\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"LPHUs will trace and manage susceptible community contacts of cases\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"healthcare institutions, such as medical practices or emergency departments\",\n      \"category\": \"hospital_emergency\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"emergency departments\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"school or other educational settings\",\n      \"category\": \"school\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"school\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"childcare, preschool\",\n      \"category\": \"childcare\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"childcare\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"workplace\",\n      \"category\": \"workplace\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"workplace\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disease\": []\n}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a text about measles exposure and contact tracing. My job is to extract temporal, spatial, event type, venue type, and disease information in JSON format.\n\nFirst, looking at the temporal extraction. The text mentions \"people born during or after 1966\" and \"born before 1966\". According to the previous rules, \"born during or after 1966\" should be normalized to 1966-01-01. So I'll note that as a date. But wait, the text doesn't have a specific date mentioned, just birth years. So maybe there's no temporal expression here. Wait, the user's previous example had a date, but in this case, the text is about birth years. The previous temporal references include \"born during or after 1966\" mapped to 1966-01-01. So I should extract that as a date. But the text doesn't have a date, just a birth year. Hmm, maybe the temporal extraction here is the birth years. But the user's instruction says to extract temporal expressions. The birth years are relative dates, so using the most recent occurrence. But the document context's current position is chunk 14 of 32, but the publication date is unknown. However, the previous temporal references include \"born during or after 1966\" as 1966-01-01. So I should extract that as a date. So the temporal entry would be \"born during or after 1966\" normalized to 1966-01-01, type date.\n\nNext, spatial. The text mentions places like \"cinemas, shopping centres, aircraft, airport transit lounges, trains and restaurants\". These are locations. Each of these is a venue type. But for spatial, the task is to extract location mentions with parent regions. However, the text doesn't specify any specific city or region, just general places. The previous spatial references include Victoria, Australia, etc., but in this text, there's no specific location mentioned. So maybe no spatial entries? Wait, the user's previous example had \"Broome, Western Australia\" as a spatial entry. But in this case, the text doesn't mention any specific location. So spatial might be empty. Unless \"aircraft\" or \"airport\" are considered, but they are general terms. So maybe no spatial entries here.\n\nEvent type: The text discusses exposure sites, like contacts in certain places, and mentions measles. The event type could be \"risk_warning\" or \"surveillance_update\". The text talks about exposure notifications and prophylaxis, which might be a risk warning. But the exact category needs to fit. The allowed categories include \"risk_warning\" which fits when there's a warning about exposure. So event_type would be \"risk_warning\" with confidence 1.0.\n\nVenue_type: The text lists venues like cinemas, shopping centres, aircraft, etc. These are all types of venues. The venue_type categories include \"shopping_center\", \"public_transport\", \"entertainment\" (for cinemas), \"aircraft\", \"airport\" (transit lounges), \"restaurant\". So each of these would be separate entries. For example, \"cinemas\" as entertainment, \"shopping centres\" as shopping_center, \"aircraft\" as aircraft, \"airport transit lounges\" as public_transport, \"trains\" as public_transport, \"restaurants\" as restaurant. Each with their respective categories and venue names if applicable. But the text doesn't specify specific names, so venue_name might be empty or the general term. Wait, the schema requires venue_name. So maybe for \"cinemas\", venue_name is \"cinemas\", but that's a bit generic. Alternatively, maybe it's not applicable. But the schema requires it. Hmm, perhaps the venue_name can be the general term. So each venue type entry would have the text as the venue name.\n\nDisease: The text mentions measles multiple times. So the disease category is \"measles\" with confidence 1.0.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nTemporal: The birth year reference normalized to 1966-01-01 as a date.\n\nSpatial: None, since no specific locations are mentioned.\n\nEvent_type: \"risk_warning\" with confidence 1.0.\n\nVenue_type: Each listed venue as separate entries with their categories.\n\nDisease: measles.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"born during or after 1966\",\n      \"normalized\": \"1966-01-01\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"born before 1966\",\n      \"normalized\": \"1965-01-01\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Contacts who cannot be individually identified but who may have been present in the general area where the case was known to be\",\n      \"category\": \"risk_warning\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"cinemas\",\n      \"category\": \"entertainment\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"cinemas\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"shopping centres\",\n      \"category\": \"shopping_center\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"shopping centres\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"aircraft\",\n      \"category\": \"aircraft\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"aircraft\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"airport transit lounges\",\n      \"category\": \"public_transport\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"airport transit lounges\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"trains\",\n      \"category\": \"public_transport\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"trains\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"restaurants\",\n      \"category\": \"restaurant\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"restaurants\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles\",\n      \"category\": \"measles\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"B05\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

First, I need to parse the text and identify all the required elements: temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, and disease.\n\nStarting with temporal expressions. The text mentions \"within 3 days (72 hours)\" and \"within 6 days (144 hours)\". These are durations, so I should normalize them to ISO 8601 format. \"3 days\" becomes \"P3D\" and \"6 days\" is \"P6D\". I'll extract both as durations.\n\nNext, spatial references. The text doesn't mention any specific locations like cities or countries. The previous context had Broome, Western Australia, but this text is about general guidelines, so no spatial data here. So the spatial array will be empty.\n\nFor event_type, the text discusses post-exposure prophylaxis, which relates to exposure sites. The category should be \"exposure_site\" with high confidence since it's about handling exposure to measles. \n\nVenue_type isn't mentioned here. The text is about guidelines, not a specific venue, so this array remains empty.\n\nDisease is clearly measles, so the category is \"measles\" with the text \"measles\" and a disease_code. The ICD-10 code for measles is B05, so I'll include that.\n\nI need to make sure all required fields are present. Temporal has two durations, event_type has one entry with confidence 1.0, and disease has the correct category and code. No spatial or venue entries. Let me double-check the schemas to ensure compliance. Looks good. Now, structure the JSON accordingly.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"within 3 days (72 hours)\",\n      \"normalized\": \"P3D\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"duration\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"within 6 days (144 hours)\",\n      \"normalized\": \"P6D\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"duration\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Post-exposure prophylaxis for measles\",\n      \"category\": \"exposure_site\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles\",\n      \"category\": \"measles\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"B05\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Pregnant women and eligible immunocompetent children receive this dose. Children and adults who have immunodeficiency diseases such as leukaemia, lymphoma or HIV infection require a higher dose (0.5 mL/kg body weight, maximum dose = 15 mL).\n\nInfants 5 months and under are now recommended to receive NHIG regardless of the birth mother\u2019s immunity to measles.\n\nControl of environment\n\nAny room visited by a case while they are infectious should be left vacant for at least 30 minutes after the patient has left. The latter period is based on the recognition that normal room ventilation systems ensure that levels of airborne viruses and virus survival diminish rapidly. This includes medical consulting rooms. Environmental clean-up is not generally recommended, although items contaminated with nasal and throat discharges should be disposed of carefully.\n\nOutbreak measures for measles\n\nOutbreaks in the community occur sporadically as a result of imported measles cases exposing local susceptible people. The epidemiology of outbreaks has changed with the introduction of childhood vaccination, and young adults are now at highest risk. Outbreaks in schools may still occur if there are significant numbers of unvaccinated students.",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a text about measles outbreak measures and asked for JSON extraction based on specific schemas. First, I need to parse the text and identify all the required elements: temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, and disease.\n\nStarting with temporal expressions. The text mentions \"left vacant for at least 30 minutes after the patient has left.\" The previous temporal references include \"up to 30 minutes after the case left\" normalized as P30M. Here, the duration is 30 minutes, so I'll convert that to P30M. There's also a mention of \"3 days (72 hours)\" which would be P3D, but the text here specifies 30 minutes, so that's the key temporal element.\n\nNext, spatial references. The text refers to \"medical consulting rooms\" and \"rooms visited by a case.\" The previous spatial references include Victoria, Australia, etc. Since the text doesn't mention specific locations like Broome, I need to check if there's any spatial info. However, the text doesn't specify a location, so maybe there's no spatial data here. Wait, the user's previous example had Broome, but this text doesn't mention any specific place. So spatial might be empty or maybe \"medical consulting rooms\" as a venue. But according to the schema, spatial requires location_type and text. Since there's no specific place, maybe spatial is not applicable here. But the user's previous response included spatial even without a specific location. Wait, the text says \"Any room visited by a case while they are infectious should be left vacant...\" So the rooms are the spatial entities. But the location_type would be \"feature\" or \"venue\"? Maybe \"feature\" as rooms are part of a building. But the parent_region isn't specified here. Hmm, maybe spatial isn't needed here. Wait, the user's previous example had \"Broome, Western Australia\" as spatial. In this case, the text doesn't mention a specific location, so spatial might be empty. But the user's instruction says to extract spatial mentions. Since the text talks about rooms, maybe that's a venue. But the schema's spatial is for locations like cities, countries, etc. So perhaps there's no spatial data here. So spatial array might be empty.\n\nEvent_type: The text discusses outbreak measures for measles, so the event_type could be \"outbreak_alert\" or \"surveillance_update.\" The text mentions outbreaks in the community, so \"outbreak_alert\" seems appropriate. The confidence is 1.0.\n\nVenue_type: The text mentions \"medical consulting rooms,\" which would fall under \"hospital_emergency\" or \"clinic_gp.\" But the venue_type schema includes categories like \"hospital_emergency,\" \"clinic_gp,\" etc. Since it's a medical consulting room, maybe \"clinic_gp\" (general practice clinic) or \"hospital_emergency.\" But the text doesn't specify if it's a clinic or hospital. However, the previous example had \"Margaret River Emergency Department\" as hospital_emergency. Here, \"medical consulting rooms\" could be part of a clinic or hospital. Since the text doesn't specify, maybe \"clinic_gp\" with venue_name as \"medical consulting rooms.\" But the schema requires venue_name. Alternatively, if there's no specific name, maybe it's \"other.\" But the user's previous example included venue_name. So perhaps \"medical consulting rooms\" as the text, category \"clinic_gp,\" and venue_name as \"medical consulting rooms.\" But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the text doesn't mention a specific venue name, maybe it's not included. Wait, the schema requires venue_name. So if the text says \"medical consulting rooms,\" that's the venue_name. So venue_type would have text \"medical consulting rooms,\" category \"clinic_gp,\" and venue_name \"medical consulting rooms.\"\n\nDisease: The text is about measles, so the category is \"measles,\" and the disease_code could be ICD-10 code for measles, which is B05. But the user's previous example didn't include disease_code, so maybe it's optional. However, the schema requires disease_code. Since the user's example had \"measles\" with category and disease_code as \"B05,\" I should include that.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nTemporal: P30M from the 30 minutes.\n\nSpatial: Maybe no entries since no specific location is mentioned.\n\nEvent_type: outbreak_alert with confidence 1.0.\n\nVenue_type: medical consulting rooms as clinic_gp.\n\nDisease: measles with code B05.\n\nWait, the text also mentions \"outbreaks in schools\" so maybe another venue_type for school. But the text says \"schools may still occur if there are significant numbers of unvaccinated students.\" So \"school\" as a venue_type. So two entries in venue_type: medical consulting rooms and school.\n\nBut the schema requires venue_name. For the school, the text says \"schools,\" so venue_name would be \"school.\" So venue_type entries would be:\n\n1. text: \"medical consulting rooms\", category: \"clinic_gp\", venue_name: \"medical consulting rooms\"\n\n2. text: \"schools\", category: \"school\", venue_name: \"school\"\n\nBut the text doesn't mention a specific school name, so venue_name is \"school.\"\n\nSo the JSON would include these.\n\nNow, checking the required fields. The schema for venue_type requires text, category, venue_name. So both entries are valid.\n\nSo the final JSON would have:\n\ntemporal: [ { \"text\": \"30 minutes after the patient has left\", \"normalized\": \"P30M\", \"temporal_type\": \"duration\" } ]\n\nspatial: [] (since no specific location mentioned)\n\nevent_type: [ { \"text\": \"Outbreaks in the community...\", \"category\": \"outbreak_alert\", \"confidence\": 1.0 } ]\n\nvenue_type: [ { \"text\": \"medical consulting rooms\", \"category\": \"clinic_gp\", \"venue_name\": \"medical consulting rooms\" }, { \"text\": \"schools\", \"category\": \"school\", \"venue_name\": \"school\" } ]\n\ndisease: [ { \"text\": \"measles\", \"category\": \"measles\", \"disease_code\": \"B05\" } ]\n\nWait, the text says \"outbreak measures for measles\" so the disease is measles. The disease_code for measles is B05 (ICD-10). So that's correct.\n\nSo the JSON should reflect all these elements.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"left vacant for at least 30 minutes after the patient has left\",\n      \"normalized\": \"P30M\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"duration\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Outbreaks in the community occur sporadically as a result of imported measles cases exposing local susceptible people\",\n      \"category\": \"outbreak_alert\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"medical consulting rooms\",\n      \"category\": \"clinic_gp\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"medical consulting rooms\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"schools\",\n      \"category\": \"school\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"school\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles\",\n      \"category\": \"measles\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"B05\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

In defined groups of susceptible people, where exposure has occurred but it is too late or not feasible to identify individuals for whom PEP may prevent infection, widespread vaccination may be indicated to minimise ongoing transmission within the group. LPHUs alongside the Department of Health conduct detailed investigations of outbreaks.\n\nSpecial settings\n\nSchools and childcare\n\nAlthough outbreaks mainly affect unvaccinated children, highly vaccinated school or childcare populations have also been affected. Cases are excluded from school and childcare for at least 4 days after rash onset. Immunised contacts are not excluded. Unimmunised/non-immune contacts should be excluded until 14 days after the first day of appearance of the rash in the last case.

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a text about measles outbreaks and vaccination, and they want the JSON extraction based on the schema they specified. \n\nFirst, I need to check the tasks again. The user mentioned five extraction tasks: temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, and disease. The previous example had some entries, but in this case, the text doesn't mention specific dates or times. Let me read through the text again.\n\nThe text starts with \"vaccination, and young adults are now at highest risk.\" There's no explicit date here. Then it talks about outbreaks in schools, exclusion periods like 4 days after rash onset, and 14 days for unimmunised contacts. The temporal mentions here are durations like 4 days, 14 days, 72 hours, 144 hours. \n\nFor temporal extraction, I need to normalize these durations. The user's previous example used P3D for 3 days. So 4 days would be P4D, 14 days P14D, 72 hours is P3D (since 72 hours is 3 days), and 144 hours is P6D (since 144/24=6). \n\nNext, spatial references. The text mentions schools and childcare, which are venues, not specific locations. The parent regions aren't specified here, so maybe \"other\" for location_type. But the user's previous example had \"school\" as a venue_type. Wait, the spatial task is for locations, so schools and childcare are venues, but the spatial extraction might not have specific locations unless they are named. Since the text doesn't mention specific cities or regions, maybe there's no spatial data here. But the user's previous example included \"school\" in venue_type. Wait, the spatial task is for locations, so maybe schools and childcare are part of venue_type, not spatial. Let me check the schema again.\n\nLooking at the schema, spatial is for locations with parent regions. The text doesn't mention specific places like cities or countries, so maybe the spatial array is empty. But the user's previous example had a spatial entry for Broome. In this case, the text doesn't mention any specific locations, so spatial might be empty.\n\nEvent_type: The text discusses outbreaks, so \"outbreak_alert\" or \"surveillance_update\". The text mentions outbreaks in schools, so maybe \"outbreak_alert\". The confidence would be 1.0.\n\nVenue_type: The text mentions schools and childcare. The venue_type categories include \"school\" and \"childcare\". So each of these would be entries in venue_type with their respective categories.\n\nDisease: The text refers to measles, so the category is \"measles\" with confidence 1.0. The disease_code might be missing, but the schema requires it. Since the user's previous example had \"measles\" with code \"B05\", but I don't have that info here. Maybe leave it as \"B05\" if it's standard, but if unsure, perhaps \"other\" or omit. Wait, the schema requires disease_code, so I need to include it. However, the user's previous example had \"measles\" with code \"B05\". Assuming that's correct, I'll use \"B05\" here.\n\nPutting it all together: temporal entries for the durations, event_type as outbreak_alert, venue_type as school and childcare, disease as measles with code B05. Spatial might be empty since no specific locations are mentioned. Let me check again. The text says \"schools and childcare\" but doesn't specify locations, so spatial is empty. \n\nWait, the user's previous example had a spatial entry even when the location was a city. In this case, the text doesn't mention any specific cities or regions, so spatial is empty. \n\nSo the JSON should have temporal with the durations, event_type as outbreak_alert, venue_type with school and childcare, disease as measles. No spatial entries. Let me structure that.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"4 days after rash onset\",\n      \"normalized\": \"P4D\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"duration\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"14 days after the first day of appearance of the rash in the last case\",\n      \"normalized\": \"P14D\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"duration\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"within 72 hours of their first contact with the first case\",\n      \"normalized\": \"P3D\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"duration\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"within 144 hours of the contact\",\n      \"normalized\": \"P6D\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"duration\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Outbreaks in schools may still occur\",\n      \"category\": \"outbreak_alert\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"school\",\n      \"category\": \"school\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"school\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"childcare\",\n      \"category\": \"childcare\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"childcare\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles\",\n      \"category\": \"measles\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"B05\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a text about measles guidelines and wants the JSON extraction as per the schema. First, I need to parse the text for temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, and disease elements.\n\nStarting with temporal expressions. The text mentions \"within 72 hours of their first contact with the first case\" and \"within 144 hours of the contact\". Using the previous temporal references, 72 hours is P3D and 144 hours is P6D. So I'll normalize those.\n\nNext, spatial references. The text doesn't mention specific locations like cities or countries, so maybe there's nothing here. But wait, the previous spatial references include Victoria and Australia. However, the current text doesn't have new locations, so spatial might be empty.\n\nFor event_type, the text talks about guidelines during an outbreak, so \"outbreak_alert\" makes sense. The confidence is high, so 1.0.\n\nVenue_type: The text mentions schools and healthcare settings like hospitals, but the exact venues aren't specified. However, the user's example had a venue_type with school. Since the text says children return to school, maybe \"school\" is a category here. But the original text doesn't name a specific venue, so maybe \"school\" as a category with venue_name as \"school\" or leave it blank? Wait, the schema requires venue_name. Hmm, maybe it's not applicable here, but the example had \"Margaret River Emergency Department\" as venue_name. Since the current text doesn't specify a venue name, perhaps venue_type isn't applicable. But the user's example included venue_type even if it was a general term. Maybe I should include \"school\" as the category with venue_name as \"school\".\n\nDisease is clearly measles, so category is measles with code as per ICD-10, but the user's example used \"measles\" without code. The schema allows \"other\" but here it's measles, so category is measles and disease_code might be missing. Wait, the required fields include disease_code. The user's example had \"measles\" with no code, but the schema requires it. Maybe the code is optional? Wait, looking back, the required fields for disease are text, category, and disease_code. So I need to include disease_code. But the text doesn't provide a code. Maybe leave it as empty string or use a placeholder. The user's example had \"measles\" with no code, but the schema requires it. Hmm, perhaps the code is not provided, so I'll put an empty string.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have temporal entries for the durations, event_type as outbreak_alert, venue_type as school, and disease as measles. Let me check again. The text mentions \"during an outbreak\" which is an outbreak_alert. The venue_type might be school since children return to school. But the text doesn't specify a particular venue, so maybe venue_type isn't applicable. However, the user's previous example included venue_type even if it was a general term. So I'll include venue_type with category school and venue_name as school. \n\nSo the final JSON should have the temporal entries, event_type, venue_type, and disease. Spatial might be empty since there are no new locations mentioned. Let me make sure I didn't miss any spatial references. The text doesn't mention any new locations, so spatial is empty. Alright, that should cover it.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"within 72 hours of their first contact with the first case\",\n      \"normalized\": \"P3D\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"duration\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"within 144 hours of the contact\",\n      \"normalized\": \"P6D\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"duration\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"during an outbreak\",\n      \"category\": \"outbreak_alert\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"school\",\n      \"category\": \"school\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"school\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles\",\n      \"category\": \"measles\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a list of terms related to healthcare services in Victoria, Australia. My job is to extract temporal, spatial, event type, venue type, and disease information from this list. \n\nFirst, looking at the temporal extraction. The user's input doesn't have any dates, times, or durations. All the terms are about services and policies, like \"Improving Cancer Outcomes (Diagnosis Reporting) Regulations 2025\". The year 2025 is mentioned here. So I need to check if that's a date. The temporal_type would be \"date\" and normalized as \"2025-01-01\" since the exact date isn't specified, just the year. But wait, the user's previous example used March 15, 2022, and normalized it as 2022-03-15. So for 2025, without a month and day, maybe the system defaults to the first day of the year? But the schema requires ISO 8601. If the original text only has the year, like \"2025\", then the normalized date would be \"2025-01-01\". But the user's instruction says for dates without years, use the most recent year in the document context. However, in this case, the document context's publication date is unknown. But the term \"2025\" is in the text, so maybe that's the date. So I'll extract \"2025-01-01\" as the normalized date for the \"Improving Cancer Outcomes...\" entry.\n\nNext, spatial extraction. The terms mention \"Victoria\" and \"Australia\" multiple times. For example, \"Standards for Safe and Timely Ambulance and Emergency Care for Victorians\" refers to Victoria. So the spatial entries would be \"Victoria\" with parent_region \"Australia\". Also, \"Victorian cancer plan\" again refers to Victoria. So I need to list each occurrence of Victoria and Australia, but since the user's previous example had \"Western Australia\" as a parent region, here \"Victoria\" would have \"Australia\" as the parent. So spatial entries would include \"Victoria\" with parent_region \"Australia\" and \"Australia\" as a country. But the user's previous example had \"Western Australia\" as a parent region, so maybe \"Victoria\" is a state within Australia. So each mention of Victoria would be a city or region? Wait, the location_type for Victoria would be \"region\" or \"city\"? The user's previous example had \"Broome\" as a city with parent region \"Western Australia\". So \"Victoria\" here is a state, so location_type would be \"region\" and parent_region \"Australia\". But the term \"Victorian cancer plan\" might refer to the state of Victoria. So I need to check each term. For example, \"Victorian State Trauma System\" would be \"Victoria\" as a region with parent Australia. Similarly, \"Victorian cancer plan\" would be the same. So spatial entries would have \"Victoria\" with parent_region \"Australia\" and \"Australia\" as a country. But the user's previous example had \"Western Australia\" as a parent region, so maybe \"Victoria\" is a state, so location_type is \"region\" and parent_region \"Australia\".\n\nEvent_type: The user's input is a list of service names. The event_type categories include things like exposure_site, case_report, etc. But the terms here are about services, not events. For example, \"First Aid Services\" is a service, not an event. So maybe the event_type is \"other\" with confidence 0.0. But the user's previous example had \"exposure_site\" for a hospital emergency. However, in this case, the terms are all about services, so event_type might not apply. But the schema requires event_type to be an array. So perhaps all entries are \"other\" with confidence 0.0. But the user's previous example had some entries with confidence 1.0. However, since the text doesn't mention any specific events, maybe all event_type entries are \"other\" with confidence 0.0. But the user's instruction says to extract event_type if applicable. Since the text is about services, not events, maybe there are no event_type entries. But the schema requires the event_type array. So perhaps leave it empty? Wait, the user's previous example had event_type entries even when the text was about a cyclone hitting Broome. Wait, in that example, the user's input was about a cyclone, but the event_type was \"exposure_site\" for a hospital emergency. But in this case, the input is about services, not events. So maybe event_type is not applicable here. But the schema requires the event_type array. So perhaps the answer would have event_type as an empty array. But the user's previous example had event_type entries. Hmm, maybe the user expects that even if there's no event, we still have to list it. But according to the instructions, the extraction tasks are to extract the specified fields. If there's no event, then the array is empty. But the user's previous example had event_type entries even when the text was about a cyclone. Wait, in the first example, the user's input was \"a cyclone hit Broome\", and the event_type was \"exposure_site\" with confidence 1.0. But that seems incorrect. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, I need to follow the schema. So for this input, since there are no events mentioned, the event_type array would be empty. But the user's previous example had event_type entries. Maybe the user expects that even if the text is about services, there's an event_type. But according to the extraction tasks, event_type is for health events. Since the text is about services, not events, perhaps event_type is not applicable. So the event_type array would be empty.\n\nVenue_type: The terms include \"Emergency Care\", \"First Aid Services\", \"Hospital in the Home\", etc. These are types of venues. For example, \"Emergency Care\" could be a hospital_emergency. \"First Aid Services\" might be a clinic_gp or clinic_specialist. \"Hospital in the Home\" is a hospital_inpatient? Or maybe a different category. But the venue_type categories include hospital_emergency, clinic_gp, etc. So for each term, I need to map it to the venue_type. For example, \"Emergency Care\" could be \"hospital_emergency\". \"First Aid Services\" might be \"clinic_specialist\" or \"clinic_gp\". \"Hospital in the Home\" is a type of hospital_inpatient? Or maybe a different category. But the user's previous example had \"Margaret River Emergency Department\" as a hospital_emergency. So for \"Emergency Care\", the venue_type would be \"hospital_emergency\". \"First Aid Services\" could be \"clinic_gp\" or \"clinic_specialist\". \"Hospital in the Home\" might be \"hospital_inpatient\". \"Ambulance and Emergency Care\" would be \"hospital_emergency\". \"Cancer care\" could be \"hospital_inpatient\" or \"clinic_specialist\". \"Renal services\" might be \"hospital_inpatient\" or \"clinic_specialist\". \"Specialist clinics\" would be \"clinic_specialist\". \"Aged care\" is \"aged_care\". \"Childcare\" is \"childcare\". \"School\" is \"school\". \"Public Transport\" is \"public_transport\". \"Shopping Center\" is \"shopping_center\". \"Community\" is \"community\". \"Outdoor\" is \"outdoor\". But the user's input has terms like \"NEPT licensing fees\" which might not map to a venue_type. So for each term, I need to assign the most appropriate venue_type. For example:\n\n- \"Emergency Care\" \u2192 \"hospital_emergency\"\n- \"First Aid Services\" \u2192 \"clinic_gp\" or \"clinic_specialist\"\n- \"Hospital in the Home\" \u2192 \"hospital_inpatient\"\n- \"Ambulance and Emergency Care\" \u2192 \"hospital_emergency\"\n- \"Cancer care\" \u2192 \"hospital_inpatient\" or \"clinic_specialist\"\n- \"Renal services\" \u2192 \"hospital_inpatient\" or \"clinic_specialist\"\n- \"Specialist clinics\" \u2192 \"clinic_specialist\"\n- \"Aged care\" \u2192 \"aged_care\"\n- \"Childcare\" \u2192 \"childcare\"\n- \"School\" \u2192 \"school\"\n- \"Public Transport\" \u2192 \"public_transport\"\n- \"Shopping Center\" \u2192 \"shopping_center\"\n- \"Virtual care (Telehealth)\" \u2192 \"clinic_specialist\" or \"other\"\n- \"Perinatal and reproductive services\" \u2192 \"clinic_specialist\"\n- \"Assisted reproduction\" \u2192 \"clinic_specialist\"\n- \"Donor conception register services\" \u2192 \"clinic_specialist\"\n- \"Voluntary Register\" \u2192 \"clinic_specialist\"\n- \"Central Register\" \u2192 \"clinic_specialist\"\n- \"Rehabilitation and complex care\" \u2192 \"hospital_inpatient\" or \"clinic_specialist\"\n- \"Renal health\" \u2192 \"hospital_inpatient\" or \"clinic_specialist\"\n- \"Specialist clinics programs\" \u2192 \"clinic_specialist\"\n- \"Specialist clinics reform\" \u2192 \"clinic_specialist\"\n- \"Specialty diagnostics, therapeutics and programs\" \u2192 \"clinic_specialist\"\n- \"Older people in hospital\" \u2192 \"hospital_inpatient\"\n- \"End of life and palliative care\" \u2192 \"hospital_inpatient\"\n- \"Advance care planning\" \u2192 \"clinic_specialist\"\n- \"Voluntary assisted dying\" \u2192 \"hospital_inpatient\"\n- \"Quality, safety and service improvement\" \u2192 \"other\"\n- \"Digital Health\" \u2192 \"other\"\n- \"Health Information Sharing Legislation Reform\" \u2192 \"other\"\n- \"Policies and frameworks\" \u2192 \"other\"\n- \"Roadmap and Maturity Model\" \u2192 \"other\"\n- \"Standards and guidelines\" \u2192 \"other\"\n- \"My Health Record\" \u2192 \"other\"\n\nBut since the user's input is a list of terms, each term might correspond to a venue_type. However, some terms are more general. For example, \"NEPT licensing fees\" might not map to a venue_type. So for each term, I need to check if it fits into any of the venue_type categories. If not, it's \"other\". \n\nDisease: The terms don't mention any specific diseases. The user's previous example had \"measles\" as a disease, but in this case, there's no mention of diseases. So the disease array would be empty.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nTemporal: Only the \"Improving Cancer Outcomes (Diagnosis Reporting) Regulations 2025\" has a date, so normalized as \"2025-01-01\".\n\nSpatial: \"Victoria\" and \"Australia\" are mentioned. \"Victoria\" is a region with parent_region \"Australia\".\n\nEvent_type: None, so empty array.\n\nVenue_type: Each term mapped to the appropriate category. For example, \"Emergency Care\" \u2192 \"hospital_emergency\", \"First Aid Services\" \u2192 \"clinic_gp\", etc.\n\nDisease: Empty array.\n\nBut the user's previous example had some entries with confidence 1.0. However, since the terms are about services, not events, the confidence might be 0.0. But the schema requires confidence between 0.0 and 1.0. So for venue_type, if the mapping is certain, confidence is 1.0. If uncertain, lower. But since the terms are service names, the mapping might be certain. For example, \"Emergency Care\" is likely a hospital_emergency. So confidence 1.0.\n\nSo the final JSON would have temporal with the 2025 date, spatial with Victoria and Australia, venue_type with each term mapped, and others empty.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Improving Cancer Outcomes (Diagnosis Reporting) Regulations 2025\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2025-01-01\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Victoria\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"Australia\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Australia\",\n      \"location_type\": \"country\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [],\n  \"venue_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Emergency Care\",\n      \"category\": \"hospital_emergency\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"First Aid Services\",\n      \"category\": \"clinic_gp\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Hospital in the Home\",\n      \"category\": \"hospital_inpatient\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Ambulance and Emergency Care\",\n      \"category\": \"hospital_emergency\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Cancer care\",\n      \"category\": \"hospital_inpatient\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Renal services\",\n      \"category\": \"hospital_inpatient\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Specialist clinics\",\n      \"category\": \"clinic_specialist\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Aged care\",\n      \"category\": \"aged_care\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Childcare\",\n      \"category\": \"childcare\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Public Transport\",\n      \"category\": \"public_transport\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Virtual care (Telehealth)\",\n      \"category\": \"clinic_specialist\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Perinatal and reproductive services\",\n      \"category\": \"clinic_specialist\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Rehabilitation and complex care\",\n      \"category\": \"hospital_inpatient\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Specialist clinics programs\",\n      \"category\": \"clinic_specialist\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Specialty diagnostics, therapeutics and programs\",\n      \"category\": \"clinic_specialist\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disease\": []\n}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a list of health-related topics and policies from Victoria, Australia. They want me to extract temporal, spatial, event type, venue type, and disease information. \n\nFirst, looking at the temporal extraction. The document mentions \"Improving Cancer Outcomes (Diagnosis Reporting) Regulations 2025\" which is a date. According to the previous references, that's normalized to 2025-01-01. I need to check if there are any other dates. The rest of the entries don't have specific dates, so only that one is relevant.\n\nNext, spatial references. The locations mentioned are Victoria and Australia. Since Victoria is a state in Australia, I should list both. The user's previous examples show that parent regions are included, so Victoria's parent is Australia. But wait, the user's previous spatial references had Australia and Victoria repeated. Need to make sure each location is listed with their parent regions. So, Victoria as a city? Wait, Victoria is a state, not a city. But in the previous example, Broome was a city with parent Western Australia. So maybe here, Victoria is a state, and Australia is the country. So spatial entries would be Victoria (region) with parent Australia, and Australia as a country. But the user's previous examples had Australia and Victoria as separate entries. Let me check the previous example again. In the first response, Broome was a city with parent Western Australia. So for Victoria, it's a region (state) with parent Australia. And Australia as a country. So I need to include both.\n\nEvent type: The user's previous example had an event type as exposure_site. But in this list, most entries are policies and frameworks. Are any of these health events? The \"Public hospital accreditation in Victoria\" might be a surveillance update or a regulation. But the user's allowed categories don't have a direct match. The closest might be \"surveillance_update\" or \"risk_warning\". But since the user's example had \"exposure_site\" for a cyclone, maybe here, the event types are not applicable. However, the user's instruction says to extract if there's a health event. Since the list is about policies, maybe there are no health events. But the user's previous example included an event type even if it was a cyclone. Wait, the first example had a cyclone as an event, but the categories allowed include \"exposure_site\". Maybe the user expects that if there's a health-related event, even if it's a policy, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there are no event types here. But the user's previous response included an event type even when the text was about a cyclone. So perhaps I should check each entry. For example, \"Preventing infections in health services\" could be a risk_warning or surveillance_update. But without specific events, maybe it's \"other\". However, the user's example had \"exposure_site\" for a cyclone, which might not be accurate. Maybe the user expects that any mention of a health-related policy is considered an event. But this is unclear. Since the user's previous example had an event type, perhaps I should include \"surveillance_update\" for policies related to health services. But I need to be cautious. Alternatively, if there's no explicit event, maybe the event_type is empty. But the user's schema requires the event_type array, so maybe it's better to leave it as empty or use \"other\" with low confidence. However, the user's previous example had an event type even when the text was about a cyclone. So perhaps I should look for any mention of events. For example, \"Public hospital accreditation in Victoria\" might be a regulatory event, but not a health event. So maybe no event types here. But the user's example included an event type, so maybe I should include \"surveillance_update\" for some entries. Alternatively, since the user's previous example had an event type for a cyclone, which isn't a health event, perhaps the user is not strict. But I need to follow the schema. Since the user's example included an event type, maybe I should include \"surveillance_update\" for policies. But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer should have no event types, but the user's schema allows for it. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me proceed with the assumption that there are no health events here, so event_type is empty.\n\nVenue type: The user's previous example had a venue type for a hospital emergency. In this list, there's \"Public hospital accreditation in Victoria\" which might relate to hospitals, but the venue_type categories include hospital_emergency, etc. But the text doesn't mention a specific venue. So venue_type might be empty.\n\nDisease: The user's previous example had measles. In this list, there's no mention of diseases. So disease array is empty.\n\nSo putting it all together: temporal has the 2025 date, spatial has Victoria and Australia, event_type is empty, venue_type is empty, disease is empty. But the user's previous example included event_type even when it was a cyclone. Maybe I should check if any of the entries are health events. For example, \"Preventing infections in health services\" could be a risk_warning. But without specific events, it's hard to assign. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that any policy is an event type. But the allowed categories don't have a policy category.

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a block of text about health service boards in Victoria, covering various topics like education resources, funding, dental care, etc. They want me to extract specific information into a JSON format based on the given schema.\n\nFirst, I need to check for temporal expressions. The text mentions \"About health service boards in Victoria\" and lists various programs and guidelines, but I don't see any dates, times, or durations. The previous context had a date in 2022, but this text doesn't include any new temporal info. So the temporal array should be empty.\n\nNext, spatial references. The text repeatedly mentions Victoria, which is a state in Australia. The parent region for Victoria would be Australia. However, the user's previous spatial references included Australia and Victoria, so I need to check if any specific locations are mentioned here. The text talks about Victoria's public dental care, so \"Victoria\" is a location_type of region with parent_region Australia. But the schema requires location_type to be one of the specified enums. \"Region\" is an option, so that's acceptable. So spatial array should have Victoria as a region under Australia.\n\nFor event_type, the text is about health service boards, policies, and programs. There's no mention of events like outbreaks, case reports, or exposure sites. The closest might be \"Community Health Integrated Program (CHIP) guidelines\" but that's more of a policy than an event. So event_type should be empty or \"other\" with low confidence. But since there's no clear event, maybe leave it empty.\n\nVenue_type: The text mentions things like \"Community Pharmacist Program,\" \"Nurse-on-Call,\" \"Urgent Care Clinics,\" etc. These could be venues. For example, \"Urgent Care Clinics\" might be clinics, so venue_type could be clinic_gp or clinic_specialist. But the text doesn't specify exact venues, so maybe \"Community Health Directory\" as a venue? But the schema requires venue_name. Since there's no specific venue names, maybe this array is empty.\n\nDisease: The text doesn't mention any specific diseases. It talks about dental health, but not a disease. So disease array is empty.\n\nWait, the user's previous example had a disease category, but in this case, there's no mention of any disease. So all arrays except spatial might be empty. Let me double-check. The text includes \"Dental health\" but that's a general topic, not a specific disease. So disease is empty.\n\nSo the final JSON should have spatial with Victoria as a region under Australia, and the rest empty. But the user's previous example had some entries, but maybe in this case, there's nothing to extract except spatial. Let me make sure I'm not missing any hidden references. The text mentions \"Local Public Health Units\" which could be a venue, but without a specific name, it's hard to categorize. Since the schema requires venue_name, and the text doesn't provide specific names, it's safer to leave venue_type empty.\n\nSo the JSON will have the spatial array with Victoria as a region under Australia. All other arrays are empty.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Victoria\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"Australia\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": []\n}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a list of various program names and services related to public health, dental care, maternal and child health, cemeteries, and medicines regulation. My task is to extract temporal, spatial, event type, venue type, and disease information from this text.\n\nFirst, looking at the temporal extraction. The user's input doesn't mention any specific dates, times, durations, or intervals. All the entries are program names or service titles without any temporal references. So the temporal array should be empty.\n\nNext, spatial extraction. The text mentions \"Victoria\" multiple times, which is a state in Australia. So I need to note that. Locations like \"Broome, Western Australia\" were in the previous example, but in this current input, the only location mentioned is Victoria. So spatial entries would include Victoria as a region with parent region Australia. But wait, the user's current input doesn't have any specific locations except Victoria. Let me check again. The entries are things like \"Victoria's public dental care fees\", \"Maternal and Child Health Service\", etc. So the spatial mentions are \"Victoria\" and possibly \"Australia\" as the parent region. But the user's previous context had Victoria and Australia mentioned, but in this current text, maybe \"Victoria\" is the main location. However, the user's input doesn't explicitly state any locations except Victoria. So spatial entries would be Victoria as a region with parent region Australia.\n\nFor event_type, the text lists various programs and services. The categories allowed include things like exposure_site, case_report, etc. But the entries here are more about programs and services, not specific events. So event_type might be \"other\" with confidence 0.5 since they are not specific events but programs. But the user's previous example had \"exposure_site\" for a cyclone, but here the entries are different. So maybe event_type is \"other\" for all, but the confidence would be lower.\n\nVenue_type: The text mentions things like \"Maternal and Child Health Service\", \"Dental health program\", etc. These are services, not specific venues. So venue_type might not apply here, but if forced, maybe \"community\" or \"other\". However, the schema requires venue_type to have category and venue_name. Since there's no specific venue mentioned, maybe leave it empty.\n\nDisease: None of the entries mention specific diseases. The previous example had measles, but here there's no disease mentioned. So disease array is empty.\n\nPutting it all together, temporal and disease arrays are empty. Spatial has Victoria as region with parent Australia. Event_type and venue_type might have \"other\" with low confidence, but since the user's previous example had specific categories, maybe event_type is \"other\" with confidence 0.5. Venue_type might not be applicable, so perhaps leave it empty. But the schema requires venue_type to have category and venue_name. Since there's no specific venue, maybe skip it. However, the user's previous example included venue_type even if it was a generic one. So perhaps for each entry, if it's a service, maybe categorize as \"community\" with venue_name as the service name. But the allowed categories for venue_type don't include \"community\" in the enum. Wait, looking back, the venue_type categories include \"community\" as one of the options. So for example, \"Maternal and Child Health Service\" could be categorized under \"community\" with venue_name as the service name. But the confidence would be lower since it's an inference.\n\nSo, for each entry, maybe extract event_type as \"other\" and venue_type as \"community\" with the service name. But the user's input is a list of program names, not specific events or venues. This is a bit ambiguous, but following the schema, I need to fill in what's possible. Since the user's previous example had \"exposure_site\" and \"hospital_emergency\", but here the entries are different, perhaps event_type is \"other\" and venue_type is \"community\" with the service name. However, the confidence would be 0.5 as it's an inference.\n\nSo the final JSON would have spatial entries for Victoria, event_type as \"other\" with confidence 0.5, venue_type as \"community\" with the service name, and others empty. But I need to check the schema again. The venue_type requires category and venue_name. So for each service, maybe create a venue_type entry. But the user's input is a list, so each line could be a separate entry. However, the user's input is a list of items, not sentences. So perhaps each item is a separate entry. But the user's previous example had a single entry. So maybe for each line, extract the relevant fields. However, the user's input is a list of terms, not sentences, so it's challenging. \n\nIn conclusion, the spatial entries would be Victoria as a region with parent Australia. Temporal and disease are empty. Event_type and venue_type would be \"other\" and \"community\" respectively, with confidence 0.5. But since the user's input is a list of terms, maybe each term is a separate entry. However, the schema requires arrays, so each term would be an entry. But without specific information, it's hard to extract. So the final JSON would have spatial entries, and others empty or with \"other\" categories.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Victoria\",\n

My task is to extract temporal, spatial, event type, venue type, and disease information as per the schema.\n\nFirst, looking at the temporal extraction. The text mentions \"Improving childhood asthma management in Melbourne's inner west\" and \"Climate and weather, and public health\". There's no specific date or time mentioned here. However, there's a reference to \"Improving Cancer Outcomes (Diagnosis Reporting) Regulations 2025\" which is normalized to 2025-01-01. But in the previous context, the user mentioned that the current position is chunk 23 of 32, and the previous temporal references include dates like 2025-01-01. Since there's no new date in the current text, maybe there's nothing to extract here. Wait, the user's input text doesn't have any dates. The only date reference is from the previous context, but the current text doesn't mention any. So temporal might be empty.\n\nNext, spatial. The text mentions \"Melbourne's inner west\" which is a region. The parent region would be Victoria, as Melbourne is in Victoria, Australia. So spatial extraction would include \"Melbourne's inner west\" as a region with parent_region \"Victoria\".\n\nEvent_type: The text talks about \"Improving childhood asthma management\" which might be a surveillance update or a risk warning. But the categories allowed are exposure_site, case_report, etc. \"Improving childhood asthma management\" could be a surveillance update or a risk warning. However, the exact category isn't clear. Maybe \"surveillance_update\" with confidence 0.5.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention any specific venues like hospitals or clinics. So venue_type might be empty.\n\nDisease: The text mentions asthma, which isn't in the allowed categories. The allowed categories are measles, influenza, etc. So disease would be \"other\" with category \"other\" and disease_code as empty.\n\nWait, the user's previous example had a disease category, but in this case, asthma isn't listed. So the disease extraction would be \"other\".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have spatial with Melbourne's inner west, event_type as surveillance_update, and disease as other. Temporal and venue_type might be empty arrays.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Melbourne's inner west\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"Victoria\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Improving childhood asthma management in Melbourne's inner west\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"asthma\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a list of topics related to health and public health in Victoria, Australia. They want me to extract temporal, spatial, event type, venue type, and disease information from this text. \n\nFirst, looking at the temporal extraction. The original text doesn't have any dates or times. All the topics are general, like \"Vaccination for adolescents\" or \"Infectious diseases guidelines & advice.\" There's no specific date mentioned, so the temporal array should be empty.\n\nNext, spatial references. The text mentions \"Victoria\" multiple times, like \"Victorian coverage rates for Victoria\" and \"Infectious diseases surveillance in Victoria.\" So, I need to extract \"Victoria\" as a location. The parent region for Victoria is Australia, but since the user's previous spatial references include Victoria and Australia, maybe I should check if Victoria is a region within Australia. So, the spatial entry would be Victoria as a region with parent region Australia. But wait, the user's previous spatial references had locations like Australia and Victoria, so maybe Victoria is a state in Australia. So, the location_type would be region, parent_region is Australia. But the user's previous examples had \"Western Australia\" as a parent region. Wait, in the previous example, Broome, Western Australia was a city with parent region Western Australia. So here, Victoria is a state, so parent region would be Australia. But maybe the user considers Victoria as a region within Australia. So, the spatial entry would be \"Victoria\" as a region with parent_region \"Australia\".\n\nFor event_type, looking at the topics. The user mentioned \"Vaccination program for adults\" and \"Vaccination for special-risk groups.\" These might relate to vaccination clinics. So, the event_type could be \"vaccination_clinic\" with confidence. Also, \"Infectious diseases guidelines & advice\" might be a surveillance update or risk warning. But the categories allowed include surveillance_update, risk_warning, etc. However, the user's previous example had \"exposure_site\" for a cyclone. But in this case, the topics are more about guidelines and programs. So maybe \"surveillance_update\" or \"risk_warning\" if there's a mention of alerts. But the text doesn't specify an event, just topics. So maybe no event_type? Wait, the user's instruction says to extract event types if they are mentioned. Since the text lists topics, perhaps there's no specific event, so event_type array is empty.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention any specific venues like hospitals, clinics, etc. So venue_type array is empty.\n\nDisease: The text mentions \"Infectious diseases\" but the allowed categories are specific diseases like measles, influenza, etc. Since it's general, the category would be \"other\" with the text as \"Infectious diseases\". But the user's previous example had \"measles\" as a category. However, in this case, the text doesn't specify a particular disease, so disease array would have \"Infectious diseases\" under \"other\".\n\nWait, but the user's previous example had \"measles\" as a category. So if the text mentions a specific disease, it's categorized. But here, the topics are general. So the disease array would have entries for any specific diseases mentioned. Since the text doesn't mention any specific disease, the disease array is empty. Wait, but \"Infectious diseases\" is a general term. The allowed categories include \"other\", so maybe that's the category. But the user's schema requires the disease array to have entries with text, category, and disease_code. So if the text mentions \"Infectious diseases\", then the category would be \"other\" and the text is \"Infectious diseases\". But the user's previous example had \"measles\" as a category. So in this case, since the text doesn't mention a specific disease, the disease array would be empty. Wait, but the user's input includes \"Infectious diseases guidelines & advice\" and \"Notifiable infectious diseases, conditions and micro-organisms\". So maybe \"Infectious diseases\" is a general term, so the category would be \"other\". But the schema requires the disease array to have entries. So perhaps the disease array would have an entry with text \"Infectious diseases\" and category \"other\".\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nTemporal: empty\nSpatial: Victoria as region, parent_region Australia\nEvent_type: maybe none, since the text lists topics, not specific events\nVenue_type: empty\nDisease: \"Infectious diseases\" as other\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Victoria\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"Australia\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Infectious diseases\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The user provided a list of topics related to health and safety, but the actual text to process is the previous example about a cyclone hitting Broome. Wait, no, looking back, the user's latest input is just the JSON schema and a note to respond in raw JSON. Wait, no, the user's message history shows that the previous interaction had the user inputting a text about a cyclone, and the assistant provided a JSON response. Now, the user is sending another query with the same structure but with a different text. Wait, no, looking at the current query, the user's input is a list of topics under various categories like Solariums, Tobacco reforms, etc., but the actual text to process is the previous example? Or is this a new text?\n\nWait, the user's current input is a list of topics, but the actual text to process is the one mentioned in the previous message. Wait, no. Let me check again. The user's message starts with \"Solariums...\" and lists various topics, but there's no actual text to extract from. The previous example had the text \"On March 15, 2022, a cyclone hit Broome a cyclone hit Broome, Western Australia\" which was processed. Now, the user's input is a list of topics, but no text. Wait, maybe the user is providing a new text? Or is this a test?\n\nWait, looking at the user's message, it's possible that the user is providing a new text, but the actual text is the list of topics. However, the list of topics doesn't contain any temporal, spatial, event, venue, or disease information. The user might have intended to provide a different text but forgot. Alternatively, this could be a test case where the input is empty. But according to the previous example, the user provided a text, and the assistant extracted data from it. Now, the user's input is a list of topics, but no actual text. So, perhaps the user is testing if the assistant can handle a scenario where there's no text to process. However, the instructions say to extract from the given text. Since there's no text here, the JSON should be empty. But the user might have made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the list of topics is the text. But that's unlikely. \n\nWait, the user's message starts with \"Solariums\" and lists various topics, but there's no actual text. So, the correct approach is to return an empty JSON object since there's no text to process. However, the user might have intended to provide a different text. But given the information, the assistant should process the text provided. Since there's no text, the JSON should have empty arrays for all categories. Let me confirm the instructions again. The user says \"Respond only in raw JSON. Schema: ...\" and the previous example had a text. Now, the user's input is the schema and a note, but no text. Therefore, the correct response is an empty JSON object with all arrays empty. But the user might have intended to provide a different text. However, based on the given input, there's no text to process. So, the answer should be empty.\n</think>\n\n{}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a list of topics related to mental health services in Victoria, Australia. They want me to extract temporal, spatial, event type, venue type, and disease information. \n\nFirst, looking at the temporal extraction. The text mentions \"Wellbeing in Victoria: A Strategy to Promote Good Mental Health 2025-35\". The date here is 2025-35, but that's a range. The user's previous example normalized \"2025-10-27\" to a date, but here it's a 5-year period. The schema allows for intervals, so I should represent it as an interval. The start would be 2025-01-01 and end as 2035-12-31. But wait, the user's previous instruction said for dates without years, use the most recent year. However, in this case, the date is a range. Maybe the user expects the start and end as separate dates. But the example given in the previous response used a single date. Hmm, maybe the user wants the 2025-35 as a duration? Wait, the schema's temporal_type includes interval. So I'll split it into start and end. But the original text doesn't specify exact dates, just the range. So I'll normalize it as an interval with start 2025-01-01 and end 2035-12-31.\n\nNext, spatial. The text mentions \"Victoria\" multiple times. The parent region for Victoria is Australia. So each occurrence of Victoria should have location_type as region and parent_region as Australia. But the user's previous example had \"Western Australia\" as a parent region. Wait, in the previous example, the location was Broome, Western Australia, so parent_region was Western Australia. But here, the text is just \"Victoria\" and \"Australia\". So for \"Victoria\", location_type is region, parent_region is Australia. But the user's previous spatial references included Victoria as a location. So I need to check if the text mentions Victoria as a region. The user's input has \"Victoria's mental health services\" and \"Victoria\" in other parts. So each mention of Victoria would be a region with parent Australia. But the user's previous example had \"Western Australia\" as a parent. So in this case, the spatial entries would be Victoria as region, parent Australia. Also, \"Australia\" is a country, so location_type country, parent_region empty or not needed. But the schema requires parent_region for disambiguation. Wait, the schema for spatial says parent_region is optional? No, looking back, the required fields are text and location_type. Parent_region is optional. So for \"Australia\", location_type is country, parent_region not needed. For \"Victoria\", location_type region, parent_region Australia.\n\nEvent_type: The text doesn't mention any health events like case reports or outbreaks. The topics are about mental health services, strategies, acts, etc. So event_type might be \"other\" with confidence 0.0. But the user's previous example had \"exposure_site\" even when not applicable. Wait, the user's previous response included \"exposure_site\" even though the text didn't mention it. Wait, no, in the previous example, the user's input was about a cyclone hitting Broome, and the assistant added \"exposure_site\" with confidence 1.0. But in this case, the text is about mental health services, so there's no health event. So event_type should be \"other\" with confidence 0.0. But the schema requires event_type to be an array. So maybe there's no event_type here. But the user's previous example included event_type even when not applicable. Wait, the user's previous response had \"event_type\" with \"exposure_site\" even though the text was about a cyclone. Maybe the assistant is supposed to extract any possible event type. But in this case, the text is about mental health services, so no specific event type. So perhaps event_type is empty. But the schema allows for \"other\" as a category. So maybe the event_type is \"other\" with confidence 0.0. But the user's previous example had confidence 1.0. Hmm, maybe the assistant should only include event_type if there's a match. Since there's no health event mentioned, event_type is empty.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention any specific venues like hospitals or clinics. So venue_type is empty.\n\nDisease: The text doesn't mention any diseases. So disease is empty.\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON would have temporal with the interval, spatial with Victoria and Australia, event_type as other with confidence 0.0, and others empty. Wait, but the user's previous example included event_type even when not applicable. Maybe the assistant should include \"other\" if no other categories fit. But the user's schema requires event_type to be an array. So perhaps the event_type is an empty array. But the user's previous example had entries. Maybe the assistant should only include entries when applicable. Since there's no health event, event_type is empty. Similarly for venue_type and disease. But the user's previous example included \"exposure_site\" even when the text was about a cyclone. Wait, that might have been a mistake. The user's input was about a cyclone, but the assistant added \"exposure_site\" which doesn't fit. So maybe the assistant made an error. But in this case, the text is about mental health services, so no event_type. So the correct approach is to leave event_type, venue_type, and disease as empty arrays. However, the user's schema requires the properties to be present but allows empty arrays. So the final JSON would have temporal with the interval, spatial with Victoria and Australia, and the other fields as empty arrays.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Wellbeing in Victoria: A Strategy to Promote Good Mental Health 2025-35\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2025-01-01/2035-12-31\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"interval\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Victoria\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"Australia\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Australia\",\n      \"location_type\": \"country\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": []\n}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a block of text related to mental health and wellbeing in Victoria, Australia. They want me to extract specific information into JSON based on the given schema.\n\nFirst, I need to check for temporal expressions. The text mentions \"Mental Health and Wellbeing Act 2022\" and \"Victoria's Take-Home Naloxone Program\" and \"Victoria\u2019s pill testing trial\". The year 2022 is present, but there are no specific dates or durations. The \"Act 2022\" refers to a legislative act, so the temporal type here would be a date. However, the exact date isn't specified, so I'll normalize it as 2022-01-01. But wait, the user's previous example used the year from the document context. Since the current position is Chunk 27 of 32, but the publication date is unknown. However, the previous temporal references include \"Improving Cancer Outcomes (Diagnosis Reporting) Regulations 2025\" normalized to 2025-01-01. So maybe the default is to use the year as given. The text mentions \"2022\" in the Act, so I'll take that as the date. But the exact date isn't specified, so I'll use 2022-01-01 as a default.\n\nNext, spatial references. The text mentions \"Victoria\" multiple times. The parent region for Victoria is Australia. So I'll extract \"Victoria\" as a city or region. Wait, the location_type options include country, city, region, etc. Since Victoria is a state in Australia, the location_type should be \"region\" with parent_region \"Australia\".\n\nFor event_type, the text talks about various services and policies. The categories allowed are exposure_site, case_report, etc. The content here is about legislation, reporting obligations, services, so none of the health events like case reports or outbreaks. The closest might be \"surveillance_update\" or \"risk_warning\", but the text doesn't mention specific events. So maybe \"other\" with confidence 0.0.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention specific venues like hospitals or clinics. It's about services and policies, so venue_type might not apply here. But the schema requires it. Since there's no venue mentioned, perhaps leave it empty or use \"other\". But the user's previous example included venue_type even if it was a different context. Wait, in the previous example, the user had a venue_type even though the text was about a cyclone. Maybe the user expects that if there's no venue, it's not included. But the schema requires the venue_type array. Hmm, maybe it's better to leave it empty or not include it. But the schema doesn't have a \"required\" field for venue_type, so it's optional.\n\nDisease: The text doesn't mention any specific diseases. The only mention is \"Take-Home Naloxone Program\" related to opioid overdose, but that's a treatment program, not a disease. So disease category would be \"other\" with confidence 0.0.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have temporal with the Act date, spatial with Victoria as region, event_type as other, venue_type maybe empty, and disease as other. But need to check the schema again. The user's previous example included venue_type even if it was a different context. Wait, in the previous example, the user had a venue_type for a cyclone, which might not be relevant. Maybe the user expects that if there's no venue, it's not included. But the schema allows for it. Since there's no venue mentioned, perhaps omit venue_type and disease. But the schema requires the properties to be present as arrays, so they can be empty. However, the user's previous example included all fields even if they were empty. Wait, no, in the previous example, the user had some entries. Let me check again.\n\nIn the previous example, the user had entries for all the required fields, even if they were empty. Wait, no, the previous example had entries for temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, and disease. But in this case, the text doesn't mention any of those. So I need to make sure that each array is present but empty or with appropriate entries. However, the user's schema allows for empty arrays. But the user's previous example included entries even when there were no matches. Wait, no, in the previous example, the user had a specific input with a cyclone, and the response included entries for all the fields. But in this case, the input is about mental health legislation, so none of the fields would have matches. Therefore, the JSON should have empty arrays for all the required properties. But the user's schema doesn't have required fields, so it's okay. However, the user's previous example included all fields even if they were empty. Wait, no, in the previous example, the user had entries for all the fields, but in this case, the text doesn't mention any of the required categories. So the correct approach is to have empty arrays for all the properties. But the user's schema allows for that. So the final JSON would have all the properties as empty arrays. But the user's previous example included entries even when there were no matches. Wait, no, the previous example had a specific input with a cyclone, and the response included entries for all the fields. But in this case, the input is about mental health legislation, so none of the fields would have matches. Therefore, the correct JSON would have all the properties as empty arrays. However, the user's schema doesn't require any of the properties, so it's acceptable. But the user's previous example included entries even when there were no matches.

They want me to extract temporal, spatial, event type, venue type, and disease information from this text.\n\nFirst, looking at the temporal extraction. The text doesn't mention any specific dates, times, durations, or intervals. All the points are about policies, programs, and services without any time references. So the temporal array should be empty.\n\nNext, spatial references. The text mentions \"Victoria\" a few times, like in \"Specialist Family Violence Advisor capacity building program in mental health and alcohol and other drug services - Victoria\" and \"Funding of alcohol and other drugs services in Victoria\". So I need to extract those. The location type for Victoria would be \"region\" or \"country\"? Since Victoria is a state in Australia, the parent region should be \"Australia\". So each mention of Victoria would be a spatial entry with location_type \"region\" and parent_region \"Australia\".\n\nFor event_type, the text lists various programs and policies. The categories allowed include things like \"surveillance_update\", \"risk_warning\", etc. However, the text doesn't mention specific events like outbreaks or case reports. The closest might be \"Public intoxication reform\" and \"New public intoxication response services\" which could be considered \"policy\" related. But the allowed categories don't have a \"policy\" option. The closest is \"surveillance_update\" or \"other\". Since there's no clear fit, maybe \"other\" with confidence 0.5.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention specific venues like hospitals, clinics, etc. It talks about services and programs, not specific locations. So venue_type array would be empty.\n\nDisease: The text doesn't mention any specific diseases. The topics are about alcohol and drug services, not specific illnesses. So disease array is empty.\n\nWait, but the user's previous example had some entries. Maybe I need to check if any of the terms could be mapped. For example, \"alcohol and other drug treatment\" might relate to \"other\" in event_type. But the user's schema requires specific categories. Since none of the entries fit the allowed categories, all arrays except spatial might be empty.\n\nSo, the spatial entries would be for Victoria, and the rest would be empty. Let me structure that.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Victoria\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"Australia\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Victoria\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"Australia\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Specialist Family Violence Advisor capacity building program in mental health and alcohol and other drug services - Victoria\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": []\n}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a list of terms related to aged care and health services, but there's no actual text to extract information from. The previous example had a sentence about a cyclone hitting Broome, which allowed extracting temporal, spatial, event type, venue type, and disease. But here, the input is just a list of headings and titles.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there are any temporal expressions. The list includes \"Our Strategic Plan 2023-27 (2025 update)\" which mentions years. The temporal normalization rules say to use the most recent year if there's no specific date. The document context's previous temporal references include 2025-01-01 for some regulations, so maybe the Strategic Plan's 2025 update would normalize to 2025-01-01. But since the user hasn't provided a specific date, I need to see if any of the terms have dates. The \"2023-27\" in the Strategic Plan might be a duration, but the format isn't clear. However, the user's previous example normalized \"March 15, 2022\" to \"2022-03-15\", so maybe \"2023-27\" could be a duration like P4Y, but the schema requires ISO 8601. Wait, the schema for temporal_type includes duration, so maybe \"2023-27\" is a duration from 2023 to 2027, which would be P4Y. But the exact text is \"2023-27 (2025 update)\", so the main date is 2023-27, which might be a period. However, without a specific date, it's tricky. The user's previous example used the most recent year if no year is given, but here, the Strategic Plan mentions 2023-27, which is a range. Maybe the temporal extraction would capture \"2023-27\" as an interval, but the schema requires start and end. However, the user's previous example didn't have intervals, so maybe it's better to not include it unless there's a clear start and end. Since the input is just a list, perhaps there are no temporal expressions to extract.\n\nNext, spatial references. The list includes \"Victoria\" multiple times in previous contexts, but the current input doesn't mention any locations. The user's previous example had \"Western Australia\" as a parent region, but here, there's no location mentioned. So spatial extraction might be empty.\n\nEvent_type: The user's previous example had \"exposure site\" and \"case report\". The current input includes terms like \"redness in residential aged care services\", \"My Aged Care assessment services\", \"HACC data reporting\", etc. These might relate to health services, but not specific events. The event_type categories include \"other\" as a fallback. Since there's no explicit event like an outbreak or case report, maybe \"other\" with confidence 0.0.\n\nVenue_type: The input mentions \"residential aged care services\", which could fall under \"aged_care\" in the venue_type categories. The text \"residential aged care services\" would be the text, category \"aged_care\", and venue_name might be missing, but the schema requires venue_name. However, the user's previous example had \"Margaret River Emergency Department\" as venue_name. Since the current input doesn't specify a name, maybe leave venue_name as empty or not include it. But the schema requires venue_name, so perhaps it's better to omit the venue_type if there's no specific name.\n\nDisease: The input doesn't mention any diseases. The previous example had \"measles\", but here, there's no disease mentioned. So disease extraction would be empty.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would have empty arrays for temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, and disease. However, the user's previous example included \"other\" in event_type when there was no clear category. So maybe for event_type, include \"other\" with confidence 0.0. Similarly, venue_type might have \"aged_care\" with venue_name as \"residential aged care services\" if that's acceptable. But the schema requires venue_name, so perhaps include that. However, the user's previous example had specific names like \"Margaret River Emergency Department\". In this case, the text is \"residential aged care services\", so maybe the venue_type is \"aged_care\" with venue_name as \"residential aged care services\".\n\nSo, the final JSON would have:\n\n- temporal: empty array\n- spatial: empty array\n- event_type: [{\"text\": \"redness in residential aged care services\", \"category\": \"other\", \"confidence\": 0.0}]\n- venue_type: [{\"text\": \"residential aged care services\", \"category\": \"aged_care\", \"venue_name\": \"residential aged care services\"}]\n- disease: empty array\n\nBut I need to check the schema again. The venue_type requires \"venue_name\" as a required field. So even if the name is the same as the text, it's okay. Similarly, event_type's confidence is 0.0 because there's no clear event. The user's previous example had confidence 1.0, but here, it's uncertain. So the JSON would have those entries.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"redness in residential aged care services\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"residential aged care services\",\n      \"category\": \"aged_care\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"residential aged care services\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disease\": []\n}",

My task is to extract temporal, spatial, event type, venue type, and disease information from this text.\n\nFirst, looking at the temporal extraction. The text doesn't mention any specific dates, times, durations, or intervals. All the entries are program names and initiatives without any temporal references. So the temporal array should be empty.\n\nNext, spatial references. The text mentions \"Victoria\" multiple times, and since all the programs are related to Victoria, I should note that. The parent region for Victoria is Australia. So I'll add an entry for Victoria as a region with parent region Australia.\n\nFor event_type, the content is about employment programs, scholarships, workforce development, etc. None of these are health events like case reports or outbreaks. The closest might be \"Mental Health and Wellbeing Workforce Scholarship Program\" but that's a program, not an event. So event_type should be empty.\n\nVenue_type isn't mentioned here either. The text doesn't talk about specific venues like hospitals or clinics. So venue_type array is empty.\n\nDisease isn't referenced anywhere in the list. All items are related to workforce and employment, not specific diseases. So disease array is also empty.\n\nI need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, with all required fields. Since there are no entries for temporal, event_type, venue_type, or disease, those arrays will be empty. The spatial array will have Victoria as a region under Australia. Let me double-check the schema to ensure I'm not missing any required fields. The required array is empty, so it's okay if some properties are missing. Alright, that should cover it.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Victoria\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"Australia\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": []\n}",

The task is to extract specific information from the given text into the specified JSON structure.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input text. The text is about measles, mentioning it's a contagious viral illness with a skin rash and fever. The user's previous example had a cyclone hitting Broome, but this text is different. \n\nLooking at the extraction tasks: temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, and disease. \n\nFor temporal, the text doesn't mention any dates, times, durations, or intervals. So the temporal array should be empty.\n\nSpatial mentions: The text doesn't have any location names. The previous example had Broome, Western Australia, but here there's no location mentioned. So spatial array is empty.\n\nEvent_type: The text talks about measles, which is a disease, but the event_type categories include things like case_report, outbreak_alert, etc. Since the text is just a general description of measles without an event, maybe \"other\" with low confidence. But the sample response had \"other\" for disease. Wait, the event_type is for health events, so if the text is just describing the disease, maybe no event_type. But the user's previous example had \"exposure_site\" even though it wasn't explicitly mentioned. Hmm, maybe the current text doesn't have an event_type, so the array is empty.\n\nVenue_type: No venue mentioned here, so empty array.\n\nDisease: The text explicitly mentions \"measles\". The category is measles, and the disease_code isn't provided, but the schema requires it. Since there's no code, maybe leave it as an empty string. The sample had \"measles\" with category and disease_code as empty. So in this case, the disease array would have an entry with text \"measles\", category \"measles\", and disease_code \"\".\n\nWait, the user's previous example had \"disease_code\": \"\" for measles. So following that, here the disease entry would be similar. \n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON should have an empty temporal, spatial, event_type, and venue_type arrays, and a disease array with the measles entry.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"measles\",\n      \"category\": \"measles\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a text about measles and contact details. First, I need to extract temporal information. The text mentions \"Measles is a contagious viral illness...\" but there's no specific date or time. The previous temporal references might help, but since the current document doesn't have any dates, maybe the default is to use the most recent year from the context. Wait, the previous context had a publication date unknown, but the user's example had a date in 2022. However, in this case, the text doesn't mention any dates. So the temporal array might be empty.\n\nNext, spatial references. The text has addresses in Melbourne, VIC 3000. The locations mentioned are \"Melbourne\" and \"Victoria\". The parent region for Melbourne would be Victoria, which is a state in Australia. So spatial entries would include Melbourne as a city with parent region Victoria, and maybe the addresses as addresses. But the schema allows location_type as address. However, the user's example had \"Western Australia\" as a parent region. So for the addresses, maybe \"Melbourne\" is the city, parent region Victoria, and the addresses are part of the spatial entries.\n\nEvent type: The text is about measles, which is a disease, but the event type categories don't include disease information. The closest might be \"surveillance_update\" or \"risk_warning\" if there's a mention of notifications. The text says \"Do not email patient notifications\" and mentions contact details for reporting, which might indicate a surveillance update or risk warning. But the example given in the previous response had \"exposure_site\" and \"case_report\". Since the current text is more about information dissemination, maybe \"surveillance_update\" with confidence 0.5.\n\nVenue type: The text includes addresses like \"Department of Health GPO Box 4057, Melbourne\" and \"50 Lonsdale Street\". These are addresses, so venue_type could be \"office\" or \"government\" but the allowed categories don't have that. The closest might be \"other\" with venue_name as the address. But the user's example had \"hospital_emergency\" for a specific venue. Since these are government offices, maybe \"other\" is the category.\n\nDisease: The text clearly mentions \"Measles\", so the category is \"measles\" with the text \"Measles\" and disease_code as \"B01\" (ICD-10 code for measles). But the user's example had \"measles\" with confidence 1.0. So that's straightforward.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have disease with measles, spatial entries for Melbourne and the addresses, event_type as surveillance_update, and venue_type as other for the addresses. Temporal might be empty since there are no dates mentioned. Let me check the schema again to ensure all required fields are there. The required array is empty, so it's okay. The confidence scores need to be between 0 and 1. For event_type, maybe 0.5 if it's a surveillance update. Venue_type as other with confidence 1.0.

The task is to extract specific fields: temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, and disease.\n\nFirst, looking at the input text: \"When autocomplete results are available use up and down arrows to review and enter to select.\" This seems like a UI instruction, not relevant for extraction. Then there's \"Home\" and other navigation links, which are probably not containing any of the required data. \n\nThe next part mentions \"Dengue\" and \"Endometriosis\" as popular topics, and regions like Africa, Americas, etc. But these are just headings or categories. The \"Latest\" section lists disease outbreak news, situation reports, etc., but the actual content isn't present here. \n\nThe user's example had a cyclone hitting Broome, which included temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, and disease. But in the current input, there's no specific event or disease mentioned. The WHO page seems to be a navigation menu without any specific event details. \n\nSo, since there's no actual data to extract, all the arrays (temporal, spatial, etc.) should be empty. The user's previous example had some entries, but this input doesn't have any relevant information. Therefore, the correct response is to return an empty JSON object as per the schema.\n</think>\n\n{}",

The main sentence here is: \"\u00a9WHO A member of volunteer vaccination team provides double doses of the oral polio vaccine to a 7 months-old Abdihakim Osman during the national immunization campaign in Hargeisa, Somaliland on 27 March 2019.\" \n\nStarting with the temporal extraction. The date mentioned is \"27 March 2019\". According to the rules, I need to normalize this to ISO 8601. So that becomes \"2019-03-27\". The type is a date.\n\nNext, spatial information. The location is Hargeisa, Somaliland. Somaliland is a region, but since it's not a country, the parent region would be Somalia. However, Somaliland is often considered a de facto independent state, but for the purpose of this extraction, I should check if the parent region is specified. The text mentions \"Somaliland\", so the parent region might be Somalia. But if the system's knowledge considers Somaliland as a region within Somalia, then parent_region should be Somalia. Alternatively, if it's treated as a separate entity, maybe the parent_region is empty. But the instruction says to include parent region for disambiguation. Since Somaliland is a region, the parent_region would be Somalia. So location_type is \"city\" for Hargeisa, and parent_region is \"Somalia\".\n\nEvent type: The sentence describes a vaccination campaign. The allowed categories include \"vaccination_clinic\". The text mentions a national immunization campaign, which is a vaccination event. So event_type is \"vaccination_clinic\" with confidence 1.0.\n\nVenue type: The text mentions a \"volunteer vaccination team\" but doesn't specify a venue. However, the activity is part of a campaign, so maybe the venue is \"community\" or \"outdoor\". But the schema requires venue_name. Since there's no specific venue name given, perhaps the venue_type is \"community\" with venue_name as \"national immunization campaign\". But the schema requires venue_name. Alternatively, if there's no specific venue, maybe \"other\" with a note. Wait, the example in the previous response had \"Margaret River Emergency Department\" as venue_name. Here, the venue isn't specified, so maybe the venue_type is \"community\" and venue_name is \"national immunization campaign\". But the user's schema requires venue_name. Alternatively, if there's no specific venue, perhaps it's \"outdoor\" or \"community\". But the text doesn't specify, so maybe \"other\" with venue_name as \"national immunization campaign\". However, the user's schema requires venue_name. Since the text doesn't mention a specific venue, maybe the venue_type is \"community\" and venue_name is \"national immunization campaign\". But I need to check the schema again. The venue_type requires \"text\", \"category\", and \"venue_name\". The text here is \"provides double doses... in Hargeisa\", but the venue isn't a specific place. So perhaps the venue_type is \"community\" and venue_name is \"national immunization campaign\". Alternatively, if there's no specific venue, maybe \"other\" with venue_name as \"campaign\". But the user's example had a specific venue name. Since the text doesn't mention a specific venue, maybe the venue_type is \"community\" and venue_name is \"national immunization campaign\". \n\nDisease: The text mentions \"oral polio vaccine\", so the disease is poliomyelitis. The category should be \"poliomyelitis\" but looking at the allowed categories, the options are measles, influenza, etc. Wait, the allowed categories for disease include \"other\". So the category would be \"other\" with the text as \"poliomyelitis\". Wait, the user's schema for disease has an enum that includes \"other\". So the correct category is \"other\" and the text is \"poliomyelitis\". But the user's example in the previous response had \"measles\" mapped to \"measles\". However, in this case, the disease is poliomyelitis, which isn't in the allowed categories. So the category should be \"other\" and the text is \"poliomyelitis\". \n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have temporal with the date, spatial with Hargeisa and parent_region Somalia, event_type as vaccination_clinic, venue_type as community with venue_name, and disease as other. \n\nWait, the user's schema for venue_type has \"category\" as one of the enums. The allowed categories include \"community\" and \"outdoor\". Since the vaccination is part of a campaign, maybe \"community\" is appropriate. The venue_name would be \"national immunization campaign\". \n\nSo the final JSON would have:\n\ntemporal: [ { \"text\": \"on 27 March 2019\", \"normalized\": \"2019-03-27\", \"temporal_type\": \"date\" } ]\n\nspatial: [ { \"text\": \"Hargeisa, Somaliland\", \"location_type\": \"city\", \"parent_region\": \"Somalia\" } ]\n\nevent_type: [ { \"text\": \"national immunization campaign\", \"category\": \"vaccination_clinic\", \"confidence\": 1.0 } ]\n\nvenue_type: [ { \"text\": \"national immunization campaign\", \"category\": \"community\", \"venue_name\": \"national immunization campaign\" } ]\n\ndisease: [ { \"text\": \"poliomyelitis\", \"category\": \"other\", \"disease_code\": \"\" } ]\n\nBut need to check if the disease_code is required. The schema says \"disease_code\" is required. Since there's no code provided, maybe leave it as an empty string. \n\nAlso, the user's example had \"measles\" mapped to \"measles\" in the disease category. But in this case, poliomyelitis isn't in the allowed categories, so \"other\" is correct. \n\nSo the final JSON should include all these elements.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"on 27 March 2019\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2019-03-27\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Hargeisa, Somaliland\",\n      \"location_type\": \"city\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"Somalia\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"national immunization campaign\",\n      \"category\": \"vaccination_clinic\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"national immunization campaign\",\n      \"category\": \"community\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"national immunization campaign\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"poliomyelitis\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a text about polio and wants me to extract specific information into JSON. First, I need to go through each section of the schema they provided.\n\nStarting with the temporal extraction. The text mentions \"since 1988\" and \"from an estimated 350 000 cases in more than 125 endemic countries, to two endemic countries). Wait, there's a typo with the closing parenthesis. But the key point is the year 1988. Since there's no specific date, just the year, I should normalize that as 1988-01-01 maybe? But the user's previous example used the year as is. Wait, the rules say for dates without years, use the most recent year in the document. But here, the text only mentions 1988. So maybe the temporal extraction would be \"1988\" as a date. Also, there's a mention of \"over 99% since 1988\" which is a duration. So I need to convert that to a duration. The text says \"decreased by over 99% since 1988\", so the duration would be from 1988 to the present. But the user's previous example normalized dates without years as the most recent year. Wait, the user's previous example had \"March 15, 2022\" normalized as \"2022-03-15\". So for the year 1988, since there's no specific date, maybe the normalized is \"1988-01-01\"? Or maybe just \"1988\" as a date. But the schema requires ISO 8601. So for a date, it's YYYY-MM-DD. Since the text only mentions the year 1988, I can't know the exact month and day. But the user's previous example used the year as is. Wait, in the previous example, the user had \"March 15, 2022\" normalized as \"2022-03-15\". So for a date with year, month, and day, it's normalized. But if the text only has the year, like \"since 1988\", then maybe the temporal_type is \"date\" with normalized as \"1988-01-01\"? Or maybe it's a duration. Wait, the text says \"since 1988\" which is a duration. So the temporal_type would be \"duration\". The duration would be P (number of years)Y. But how many years? The text says \"over 99% since 1988\", but the exact duration isn't specified. However, the user's previous example had \"on 27 March 2019\" normalized as \"2019-03-27\". So for the year 1988, maybe the normalized is \"1988-01-01\" as a date. But the text mentions \"since 1988\", which is a duration. So perhaps the temporal extraction would be \"since 1988\" as a duration. But how to represent that in ISO 8601? Maybe P (number of years)Y. But the text doesn't specify the exact duration. Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe the user expects the year 1988 as a date, and the duration as \"P\" something. Wait, the user's previous example had a date with a specific day. So maybe in this case, the temporal extraction would be the year 1988 as a date, and the duration as \"since 1988\" which is a duration. But the exact duration isn't given. Alternatively, maybe the \"since 1988\" is considered a duration starting from 1988. But without an end date, it's hard to represent. Maybe the user expects the year 1988 as a date. Let me check the text again. The text says \"since 1988\" and \"from an estimated 350 000 cases in more than 125 endemic countries, to two endemic countries). So the start date is 1988, and the end is the present. But the user's previous example normalized dates without years as the most recent year. Wait, the user's previous example had a date with a specific day, so maybe here, the temporal extraction would be the year 1988 as a date. So the normalized would be \"1988-01-01\" as a date. Then, the duration \"since 1988\" would be a duration. But how to represent that? Maybe the duration is \"P\" followed by the number of years. But the text doesn't specify the exact duration. Alternatively, maybe the user expects only the date 1988. Let me proceed with that.\n\nNext, spatial extraction. The text doesn't mention any specific locations. The previous example had \"Broome, Western Australia\" as a spatial. But in this text, there's no location mentioned. So the spatial array would be empty.\n\nEvent_type: The text talks about the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, reduction in cases, risk of resurgence, etc. The event_type categories include surveillance_update, risk_warning, etc. The text mentions \"the world stands on the threshold of eradicating a human disease globally for only the second time in history, after smallpox in 1980.\" This might be a surveillance_update or a risk_warning. But the text also says \"Failure to eradicate polio from these last remaining strongholds could result in a global resurgence of the disease.\" That sounds like a risk_warning. So the event_type would be \"risk_warning\" with confidence 1.0.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention any specific venues, so this array would be empty.\n\nDisease: The text clearly mentions \"polio\" and \"wild poliovirus\". The category for disease is \"other\" since the allowed categories don't include polio. Wait, looking at the allowed categories for disease: measles, influenza, covid19, pertussis, meningococcal, hepatitis, gastroenteritis, dengue, ross_river_virus, other. So polio isn't listed, so it should be \"other\". The text also mentions \"polio\" and \"wild poliovirus\", so the disease category is \"other\".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would have temporal with the date 1988-01-01, event_type as risk_warning, disease as other. The spatial and venue_type arrays would be empty. Wait, but the user's previous example had a temporal array with a date. Let me check again. The text says \"since 1988\" which is a duration. But the user's previous example normalized a date with a specific day. So maybe the temporal extraction here is the year 1988 as a date. But the text also mentions \"since 1988\" which is a duration. So perhaps two temporal entries: one for the date 1988 and one for the duration. But the user's schema allows for temporal_type as duration. However, the text doesn't specify the exact duration, so maybe only the date 1988 is extracted. Alternatively, the \"since 1988\" could be a duration starting from 1988. But without an end date, it's hard to represent. Maybe the user expects the date 1988 as a date. So the temporal array would have one entry with normalized \"1988-01-01\" and temporal_type \"date\". Then, the event_type is \"risk_warning\" with confidence 1.0. Disease is \"other\". The rest are empty.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"since 1988\",\n      \"normalized\": \"1988-01-01\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Failure to eradicate polio from these last remaining strongholds could result in a global resurgence of the disease\",\n      \"category\": \"risk_warning\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"polio\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The virus is transmitted by person-to-person spread mainly through the faecal-oral route or, less frequently, by a common vehicle (for example, contaminated water or food) and multiplies in the intestine. Initial symptoms are fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness of the neck and pain in the limbs. One in 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis (usually in the legs). Among those paralysed, 5\u201310% die when their breathing muscles become immobilized.\n\nPolio mainly affects children under 5 years of age. However, anyone of any age who is unvaccinated can contract the disease.\n\nThere is no cure for polio, it can only be prevented. Polio vaccine, given multiple times, can protect a child for life. There are two vaccines available: oral polio vaccine and inactivated polio vaccine. Both are effective and safe, and both are used in different combinations worldwide, depending on local epidemiological and programmatic circumstances, to ensure the best possible protection to populations can be provided.\n\nEradication\n\nThe strategies for polio eradication work when they are fully implemented. This is clearly demonstrated by the successful eradication of the disease in most countries of the world.",

First, I need to check the instructions again to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nStarting with the temporal extraction. The text doesn't mention any dates, times, or durations. The user's previous example had a date, but here the text is about polio's characteristics and eradication. So the temporal array should be empty.\n\nNext, spatial references. The text doesn't mention any locations or places. The previous example had a city and region, but this text doesn't have any. So spatial array is also empty.\n\nEvent type: The text discusses polio, its transmission, symptoms, and prevention. There's no mention of an event like an outbreak, case report, or vaccination clinic. The closest is talking about eradication strategies, but that's more of a general statement. So event_type might be \"surveillance_update\" or \"risk_warning\"? Wait, the allowed categories include \"surveillance_update\" and \"risk_warning\". The text mentions strategies for eradication and that they work when fully implemented. Maybe that's a surveillance update? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since it's about prevention and vaccination, maybe \"vaccination_clinic\"? But the text doesn't mention a specific clinic. Hmm. The user's previous example had \"exposure_site\" with confidence 1.0. But here, maybe there's no clear event type. So perhaps the event_type array is empty or maybe \"risk_warning\" if the text is a warning about polio. But the text is more informative than a warning. Maybe \"surveillance_update\" as it's about monitoring and eradication strategies. But I'm not certain. The user's example had \"exposure_site\" even though the text didn't mention a specific site. Maybe in this case, there's no event type. So event_type could be empty.\n\nVenue type: The text doesn't mention any venues like hospitals, clinics, etc. So venue_type array is empty.\n\nDisease: The text clearly mentions \"polio\" and the category should be \"other\" since the allowed categories don't include polio. The user's previous example had \"measles\" as a category. So here, the disease is \"polio\" with category \"other\".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have empty arrays for temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, and a disease entry with category \"other\".\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"polio\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

First, I need to go through each of the five extraction tasks: temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, and disease.\n\nStarting with temporal expressions. The text mentions \"once and for all\" but no specific dates. The user's previous example had a date, but here there's none. So maybe the temporal array will be empty? Wait, the user's previous response had a date, but in this case, the text doesn't have any dates. So temporal should be an empty array.\n\nNext, spatial. The text talks about Afghanistan and Pakistan where polio is still endemic. Those are countries, so location_type would be \"country\". Parent_region isn't needed here since they're already countries. So two spatial entries for Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nEvent_type: The text discusses the Polio Eradication Strategy, which is more of a surveillance update or a risk warning. The categories include surveillance_update and risk_warning. The text mentions ongoing transmission and the need to stop polio, which sounds like a risk warning. So event_type would be \"risk_warning\" with confidence 1.0.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention any specific venues like hospitals or clinics. So venue_type array is empty.\n\nDisease: The text clearly mentions polio, so category is \"other\" since the allowed categories don't include polio. Wait, looking back at the allowed categories for disease: the options are measles, influenza, covid19, etc., and \"other\". Since polio isn't listed, it should be \"other\". The disease_code might be a code like B05.0, but the user didn't specify, so maybe leave it as empty or use \"other\" for category.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have empty arrays for temporal and venue_type, spatial with Afghanistan and Pakistan, event_type as risk_warning, and disease as other with polio. Need to make sure all required fields are present and the enums are correct.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Afghanistan\",\n      \"location_type\": \"country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Pakistan\",\n      \"location_type\": \"country\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Failure to stop polio in these last remaining areas could result in global resurgence of the disease\",\n      \"category\": \"risk_warning\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"polio\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a text about the global effort to eradicate polio and wants the JSON extraction based on the schema they provided. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the text for temporal expressions. The text mentions \"In 1994, the WHO Region of the Americas was certified polio-free...\" and similar dates for other regions. These are specific dates, so I'll normalize them to YYYY-MM-DD. The years are 1994, 2000, and 2002. Since the text doesn't mention months or days for those, I'll just use the year as the normalized date. The temporal_type here is \"date\".\n\nNext, spatial mentions. The text refers to regions like \"WHO Region of the Americas\", \"WHO Western Pacific Region\", and \"WHO European Region\". These are regions, so location_type should be \"region\". The parent_region isn't specified, but since they're WHO regions, maybe they are part of the country or global. However, the schema allows parent_region as a string, so I'll note them as such. But the user's previous example had parent regions like \"Western Australia\", so maybe here, the parent_region is the country or the WHO region itself. Wait, the text says \"WHO Region of the Americas\", which is a region, so parent_region might be the country, but since it's a WHO region, perhaps it's better to leave parent_region as empty or use the region name. Hmm, the schema requires location_type and optionally parent_region. Since the regions are part of the WHO, maybe the parent_region is the country, but the text doesn't specify. So I'll list them as regions without parent_region unless specified. Wait, the user's previous example had \"Western Australia\" as the parent region for Broome. In this case, the regions mentioned are WHO regions, which are larger than countries. So maybe the parent_region is the country, but the text doesn't mention that. So perhaps just list the region as the location_type without parent_region. But the schema requires parent_region to be a string. Maybe the parent_region is the country, but since the text doesn't specify, I'll leave it as an empty string or not include it. Wait, the required fields are text and location_type. Parent_region is optional. So I'll include the text and location_type, and leave parent_region out unless there's a way to infer it. Since the text doesn't mention parent regions for these WHO regions, I'll omit parent_region.\n\nFor event_type, the text talks about the global effort to eradicate polio, which is a public health initiative. The categories include \"surveillance_update\" or \"risk_warning\". The text mentions \"Public Health Initiative of International Concern\" and \"temporary recommendations by an Emergency Committee\". This might fit under \"risk_warning\" or \"surveillance_update\". The event_type category could be \"surveillance_update\" since it's about monitoring and recommendations. Confidence is 1.0 as it's a direct mention.\n\nVenue_type isn't mentioned here. The text doesn't talk about specific venues like hospitals or clinics, so this array will be empty.\n\nDisease is clearly polio, which is not in the allowed categories. The allowed categories are measles, influenza, etc., and \"other\" is an option. So the category should be \"other\" with the text as \"polio\".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have temporal entries for 1994, 2000, 2002, spatial entries for the WHO regions as type region, event_type as surveillance_update, and disease as other.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"In 1994\",\n      \"normalized\": \"1994-01-01\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"in 2000\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2000-01-01\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"in June 2002\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2002-06-01\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"WHO Region of the Americas\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"WHO Western Pacific Region\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"WHO European Region\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"global effort to eradicate polio\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"polio\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a text about polio eradication and wants me to extract specific information into JSON. First, I need to parse the text and identify all the temporal expressions. \n\nLooking at the text, there are several dates mentioned. The first part talks about the WHO regions being certified polio-free. The Americas in 2000, Western Pacific in 2000, European Region in June 2002. Then the South-East Asia Region on 27 March 2014, and Africa in 2020. Also, there are dates in the news section: 28 July 2025, 15 July 2025, 29 May 2025, 3 September 2025, 25 September 2024, 6 May 2024. \n\nFor temporal extraction, I need to normalize these dates. The user provided previous references, but since the current context is chunk 7 of 8, maybe the most recent year is 2025? Wait, the text mentions 2025 dates, so maybe the most recent year is 2025. But the user's previous references include dates like 2019-03-27, 1988, etc. But in this text, the latest date is 2025. So for relative dates without years, like \"in 2000\" or \"June 2002\", I should use the normalized format as per the user's previous examples. \n\nFor example, \"in 2000\" becomes 2000-01-01, \"June 2002\" becomes 2002-06-01. The specific dates like \"27 March 2014\" would be 2014-03-27. The 2020 date is just 2020-01-01. The 2025 dates are specific, so they should be converted to YYYY-MM-DD. \n\nNext, spatial references. The text mentions WHO regions like the Americas, Western Pacific, European, South-East Asia, Africa. These are regions, so location_type should be \"region\". Parent_region might be \"World\" or \"Global\", but the user's previous examples had parent regions like \"Western Australia\". However, WHO regions are part of the World Health Organization's structure, so maybe the parent_region is \"World\" or \"Global Health Organization\". But the user's previous examples didn't have that, so maybe just the region name. Wait, the user's previous spatial references included \"Western Australia\" as a parent region for Broome. So for the WHO regions, perhaps the parent_region is \"World\" or \"Global\". But the user's examples might not have that. Alternatively, maybe the parent_region is left blank unless specified. Wait, the user's previous example for Broome had parent_region as \"Western Australia\". So for the WHO regions, since they are regions within the WHO, maybe the parent_region is \"World Health Organization\" or \"Global\". But the user's previous examples didn't have that. Hmm, maybe the parent_region is not applicable here, so perhaps leave it as empty or use \"World\". But the schema requires \"parent_region\" as a string. Maybe the parent_region is \"World\" for all WHO regions. \n\nThen, event_type. The text mentions certification of polio-free regions, which is a surveillance update or a risk warning. The categories allowed are exposure_site, case_report, outbreak_alert, risk_warning, surveillance_update, vaccination_clinic, other. Since the WHO certifying regions as polio-free is a surveillance update, so category would be \"surveillance_update\". \n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention specific venues like hospitals or clinics, so maybe this section is empty. \n\nDisease: The text mentions polio, which is not in the allowed categories. The allowed categories are measles, influenza, covid19, etc. So \"polio\" would be \"other\". \n\nWait, the user's allowed categories for disease include \"other\", so I can use that. \n\nNow, putting it all together. For temporal, each date needs to be normalized. For spatial, each WHO region as a location_type \"region\" with parent_region \"World\" or \"Global\". \n\nLet me check the exact text again. The first part: \"the WHO Region of the Americas was certified polio-free, followed by the WHO Western Pacific Region in 2000 and the WHO European Region in June 2002.\" So the dates here are 2000, June 2002, 2014-03-27, 2020. Then the news section has dates like 28 July 2025, etc. \n\nSo for temporal, each date should be normalized. For example, \"in 2000\" becomes 2000-01-01, \"June 2002\" becomes 2002-06-01, \"27 March 2014\" becomes 2014-03-27, \"2020\" becomes 2020-01-01, and the 2025 dates as 2025-07-28, etc. \n\nFor spatial, the WHO regions are locations, so location_type is \"region\", parent_region is \"World\" or \"Global\". \n\nEvent_type: The certification of polio-free regions is a surveillance update. \n\nDisease: \"polio\" is not in the allowed categories, so \"other\". \n\nVenue_type: No specific venues mentioned, so empty array. \n\nSo the JSON should have temporal entries for each date, spatial entries for each WHO region, event_type as surveillance_update, disease as other. \n\nI need to make sure all required fields are present. For example, in the event_type, the text is the original mention, category is \"surveillance_update\", confidence 1.0. \n\nSimilarly, for spatial, each region's text is the name, location_type \"region\", parent_region \"World\". \n\nI think that's all. Let me structure the JSON accordingly.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"the WHO Region of the Americas was certified polio-free, followed by the WHO Western Pacific Region in 2000 and the WHO European Region in June 2002\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2000-01-01\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"the WHO European Region in June 2002\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2002-06-01\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"On 27 March 2014, the WHO South-East Asia Region was certified polio-free\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2014-03-27\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"In 2020, Africa became the fifth region to be certified wild poliovirus-free\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2020-01-01\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Statement of the Forty-second meeting of the Polio IHR Emergency Committee 28 July 2025\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2025-07-28\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Global childhood vaccination coverage holds steady, yet over 14 million infants remain unvaccinated \u2013 WHO, UNICEF 15 July 2025\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2025-07-15\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Malawi Secures Gains Against Polio, Strengthens Health Systems for the Future 29 May 2025\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2025-05-29\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Transition for Sustaining a Polio-Free World 3 September 2025\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2025-09-03\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Donors making a difference: United against mpox, swift and effective response in action 25 September 2024\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2024-09-25\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Donors making a difference: CERF helps WHO deliver on its pledge for one billion more people better protected from health emergencies 6 May 2024\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2024-05-06\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"WHO Region of the Americas\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"World\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"WHO Western Pacific Region\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"World\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"WHO European Region\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"World\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"WHO South-East Asia Region\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"World\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Africa\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"World\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"the WHO Region of the Americas was certified polio-free, followed by the WHO Western Pacific Region in 2000 and the WHO European Region in June 2002\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"In 2020, Africa became the fifth region to be certified wild poliovirus-free\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"polio\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Let me start by reading through the text carefully.\n\nFirst, the text mentions \"Donors making a difference: CERF helps WHO deliver on its pledge for one billion more people better protected from health emergencies 6 May 2024.\" So, the temporal part here is \"6 May 2024\". According to the rules, I need to normalize this to ISO 8601 format. Since it's a date, it should be \"2024-05-06\". The temporal_type would be \"date\".\n\nNext, looking for spatial references. The text doesn't mention any specific locations like cities or countries. The previous spatial references included Hargeisa, Somaliland, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Africa, but this text doesn't add new locations. So, the spatial array might be empty here.\n\nFor event_type, the text talks about donors helping with health emergencies. The categories allowed include surveillance_update, risk_warning, etc. Since it's about donors contributing to protection, maybe \"surveillance_update\" fits, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, \"risk_warning\" could be if there's a risk mentioned. However, the text is more about donor actions rather than an event. Maybe \"other\" is the safest choice here, but I need to check. The original example had \"risk_warning\" for a polio risk, so perhaps this is a surveillance update related to health emergencies. I'll go with \"surveillance_update\" with confidence 0.8.\n\nVenue_type isn't mentioned here, so the array will be empty.\n\nDisease isn't mentioned either, so the disease array is empty.\n\nWait, the user's previous example had a disease category, but in this case, there's no disease mentioned. So the disease array should be empty.\n\nLet me double-check the text again. The key points are the date and the mention of health emergencies. No specific diseases or venues. So the JSON should have the temporal entry, and the rest as empty arrays. The event_type might be \"surveillance_update\" or \"other\". Since the text is about donors helping with health emergencies, maybe \"surveillance_update\" is appropriate. Alternatively, if there's no clear event type, \"other\" with lower confidence. But the user's previous example used \"risk_warning\" for a polio risk. Here, the text is about donors making a difference, so maybe it's a surveillance update. I'll set event_type as \"surveillance_update\" with confidence 0.8.\n\nSo the final JSON should include the temporal entry, and the other arrays empty. Let me structure that.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"6 May 2024\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2024-05-06\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Donors making a difference: CERF helps WHO deliver on its pledge for one billion more people better protected from health emergencies\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.8\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": []\n}",

The task is to extract specific fields: temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, and disease.\n\nFirst, looking at the input text: \"When autocomplete results are available use up and down arrows to review and enter to select.\" This seems like a UI instruction, not relevant for extraction. Then there's \"Home\" and other navigation links, which are probably not containing any of the required data. \n\nThe next part mentions \"Dengue\" and other diseases, but the actual content might be in the sections. However, the user's input here is just the HTML structure, not the actual content. The example given by the user earlier had a cyclone hitting Broome, but in this case, the input doesn't have any specific event details. \n\nSince there's no actual text with dates, locations, events, venues, or diseases mentioned, all the required fields would be empty arrays. The user's previous example had data, but this input doesn't have any. So the correct response is to return an empty JSON object as per the schema.\n</think>\n\n{}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a block of text about WHO's data hub and a specific mention of dengue in Brazil. They want the output in a specific JSON format based on the schema provided.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the text for temporal expressions. The key fact mentions \"21 August 2025\" which is a date. So I'll normalize that to \"2025-08-21\" as a date type.\n\nNext, spatial mentions. The text says \"Brazil\" and \"local residents\" but the main location is Brazil. Since it's a country, location_type is \"country\" and parent_region isn't needed here. However, the example in the previous response included parent_region for states, but Brazil is a country, so maybe just \"country\" is enough. Wait, the user's example had \"Western Australia\" as parent_region for Broome. So for Brazil, since it's a country, parent_region might not apply. But the schema allows parent_region as a string. Maybe leave it out or set to empty? Wait, the required fields for spatial are text and location_type. Parent_region is optional. So I'll include Brazil as location_type \"country\" with no parent_region.\n\nEvent_type: The text mentions community health workers visiting residents to destroy mosquito breeding sites. This seems like an exposure site because they're addressing a vector (mosquitoes) that spreads dengue. So category \"exposure_site\" with confidence 1.0.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention a specific venue like a hospital or clinic. It's about community workers, so maybe \"community\" as the category. The venue_name could be \"local residents\" but that's not a venue. Alternatively, since they're visiting residents, maybe the venue is \"outdoor\" or \"community\". The schema's venue_type includes \"community\" as a category. So I'll set category to \"community\" and venue_name as \"local residents\" if possible. But the example in the previous response had \"Margaret River Emergency Department\" as venue_name. Here, the venue is the community, so maybe venue_name is \"local residents\" or leave it as empty. Wait, the required fields for venue_type are text, category, and venue_name. The text is \"community health workers visit local residents...\", so text would be that, category \"community\", and venue_name \"local residents\".\n\nDisease: The text clearly states \"Dengue\" which is a category in the schema. So category \"dengue\" and disease_code could be \"A91\" (ICD-10 code for dengue). But the user's example didn't include disease_code, so maybe it's optional. However, the schema requires disease_code. Wait, looking back, the required fields for disease are text, category, and disease_code. So I need to include disease_code. Since the user's example had \"measles\" with code \"B05\", but the actual code for dengue is A91. So I'll use \"A91\" as the disease_code.\n\nPutting it all together, I need to make sure all required fields are present. Let me check each section again to ensure compliance with the schema.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"21 August 2025\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2025-08-21\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Brazil\",\n      \"location_type\": \"country\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"community health workers visit local residents to help find and destroy mosquito breeding sites\",\n      \"category\": \"exposure_site\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"community health workers visit local residents\",\n      \"category\": \"community\",\n      \"venue_name\": \"local residents\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"dengue\",\n      \"category\": \"dengue\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"A91\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

There is no specific treatment for dengue/severe dengue, and early detection and access to proper medical care greatly lower fatality rates of severe dengue.\n\nOverview\n\nDengue (break-bone fever) is a viral infection that is spread from mosquitoes to people. It is more common in tropical and subtropical than in temperate climates.\n\nMost people who get dengue do not have symptoms. For those who do, the most common symptoms are high fever, headache, body aches, nausea and rash. Most get better in 1\u20132 weeks. Some develop severe dengue and need care in a hospital.\n\nIn severe cases, dengue can be fatal.\n\nYou can lower your risk of dengue by avoiding mosquito bites, especially during the day.\n\nDengue is treated through pain management as there is no specific treatment currently.\n\nSymptoms\n\nMost people with dengue have mild or no symptoms and will get better in 1\u20132 weeks. Rarely, dengue can be severe and lead to death.\n\nIf symptoms occur, they usually begin 4\u201310 days after infection and last for 2\u20137 days. Symptoms may include:\n\nhigh fever (40\u00b0C/104\u00b0F)\n\nsevere headache\n\npain behind the eyes\n\nmuscle and joint pains\n\nnausea\n\nvomiting",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a text about dengue and wants me to extract specific information into JSON. First, I need to check the tasks again. The tasks are to extract temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, and disease.\n\nLooking at the text, there's no explicit date mentioned, so the temporal extraction might be tricky. The first sentence says \"\u2013400 million infections occurring each year.\" The hyphen might be a typo, but the key part is \"each year.\" Since there's no specific date, maybe I can't extract a temporal expression here. The user's previous example had a date, but this text doesn't have one. So temporal might be empty or maybe the \"each year\" is a duration. Wait, the temporal_type includes duration. So \"each year\" could be normalized as P1Y. But the original text is \"400 million infections occurring each year.\" So the text is \"each year,\" which is a duration. So normalized as P1Y. But the user's previous example had a date, but here it's a duration. So I should include that.\n\nFor spatial, the text mentions \"tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide\" and \"urban and semi-urban areas.\" But there's no specific location name. So maybe no spatial entries. Unless \"worldwide\" is considered a region, but the location_type options don't have a global category. The allowed types are country, city, region, etc. So maybe no spatial entries here.\n\nEvent_type: The text is about dengue, which is a disease. The event_type categories include case_report, outbreak_alert, etc. But the text is more of an overview, not a specific event. So maybe \"surveillance_update\" or \"risk_warning\"? The text talks about prevention, treatment, symptoms. Maybe \"risk_warning\" since it's about the risks of dengue. But the confidence might be low. Alternatively, since it's information about dengue, maybe \"surveillance_update.\" But the user's previous example had \"exposure_site\" but that's different. So perhaps \"risk_warning\" with confidence 0.8 or something. But I need to check the allowed categories again. The allowed categories are exposure_site, case_report, outbreak_alert, risk_warning, surveillance_update, vaccination_clinic, other. Since the text is providing information about dengue's spread and prevention, maybe \"surveillance_update\" or \"risk_warning.\" But I'm not sure. Maybe \"other\" if none fit. Alternatively, since it's an overview, maybe no event_type. But the user's previous example had an event_type even if it was a general one. Hmm.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention any specific venue, so maybe no entries here.\n\nDisease: The text clearly mentions \"dengue\" and \"DENV\" (Dengue virus). The category is \"dengue\" and the code could be something like B97 (ICD-10 for dengue). But the user's schema requires disease_code as ICD-10 or SNOMED. So I'll need to check. For example, ICD-10 code for dengue is B97. So the disease entry would have text \"dengue\" and category \"dengue\" with code \"B97.\"\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nTemporal: The \"each year\" is a duration, so normalized as P1Y. The text is \"\u2013400 million infections occurring each year.\" So the temporal entry would be text: \"\u2013400 million infections occurring each year\", normalized: \"P1Y\", type: duration.\n\nSpatial: None, since no specific locations.\n\nEvent_type: Maybe \"risk_warning\" with confidence 0.8, but the text is more informational. Alternatively, \"surveillance_update\" with confidence 0.8. But the user's previous example had \"exposure_site\" even if it was a general one. Maybe \"other\" if none fit. But the text is about dengue's spread and prevention, so maybe \"risk_warning\" is appropriate.\n\nVenue_type: None.\n\nDisease: \"dengue\" with category \"dengue\" and code \"B97.\"\n\nWait, the user's previous example had \"measles\" as the disease, but here it's dengue. So the disease category should be \"dengue\" and code \"B97.\"\n\nSo the JSON would have temporal with duration, disease with dengue, and maybe event_type as risk_warning or other. But I need to decide. Since the text is providing information about dengue's risks, maybe \"risk_warning\" is the best fit. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, since there's no specific event, maybe \"other.\" But the user's previous example had \"exposure_site\" even if it was a general one. So perhaps \"risk_warning\" with confidence 0.8.\n\nBut the user's schema requires confidence between 0.0-1.0. So I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"\u2013400 million infections occurring each year\",\n      \"normalized\": \"P1Y\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"duration\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Prevention and control of dengue rely on vector control\",\n      \"category\": \"risk_warning\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.8\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"dengue\",\n      \"category\": \"dengue\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"B97\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a text about dengue symptoms, diagnostics, and treatment. They want me to extract specific information into JSON based on the given schema.\n\nFirst, I need to check for temporal expressions. The text mentions \"last for 2\u20137 days.\" That's a duration. Normalizing that to ISO 8601 would be P7D, but since the user's previous example used P1Y for similar relative terms, maybe P7D is correct. Wait, the previous example had \"\u2013400 million infections occurring each year\" normalized to P1Y. So \"2\u20137 days\" would be P7D. But the exact duration isn't specified, so maybe it's better to use P7D as the maximum. Also, the text doesn't have specific dates or times, so temporal extraction might only include the duration.\n\nNext, spatial mentions. The text doesn't mention any specific locations like cities or countries. So the spatial array might be empty.\n\nFor event_type, the text is about dengue symptoms and treatment, not an event like an outbreak or case report. So maybe \"surveillance_update\" or \"risk_warning\"? The user's previous example had \"exposure_site\" for a cyclone, but here it's more about disease information. The allowed categories include \"surveillance_update\" or \"risk_warning.\" Since it's information about dengue, maybe \"surveillance_update\" with confidence 0.8.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention any specific venues like hospitals or clinics. So this array might be empty.\n\nDisease: The text clearly mentions dengue, so the category is \"dengue\" with confidence 1.0. The disease_code could be \"A91\" (ICD-10 code for dengue).\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have temporal with the duration, disease with dengue, and maybe event_type as surveillance_update. Let me double-check the schema requirements. The required fields for each section are checked. Temporal requires text, normalized, and type. Spatial and venue_type might be empty. Event_type needs text, category, and confidence. Disease needs text, category, and code. I think that's all.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"last for 2\u20137 days\",\n      \"normalized\": \"P7D\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"duration\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Diagnostics and treatment\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.8\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"dengue\",\n      \"category\": \"dengue\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"A91\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen and aspirin should be avoided as they can increase the risk of bleeding.\n\nFor people with severe dengue, hospitalization is often necessary.\n\nGlobal burden\n\nThe incidence of dengue has grown dramatically worldwide in recent decades, with the number of cases reported to WHO increasing from 505 430 cases in 2000 to 14.6 million in 2024. The vast majority of cases are asymptomatic or mild and self-managed, and hence the actual numbers of dengue cases are under-reported. The disease is now endemic in more than 100 countries.\n\nIn 2024, more cases of dengue were recorded than ever before in a 12-month period, affecting over 100 countries on all continents. During 2024, ongoing transmission, combined with an unexpected spike in dengue cases, resulted in a historic high of over 14.6 million cases and more than 12 000 dengue-related deaths reported. The Region of the Americas contributed a significant proportion of the global burden, with over 13 million cases reported to WHO.",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a text about dengue and wants me to extract specific information into JSON. First, I need to parse the text and identify all the temporal, spatial, event types, venue types, and diseases mentioned.\n\nStarting with the temporal expressions. The text mentions \"in 2024\" and \"2024\" multiple times. The first temporal reference is \"in 2024\" which is a year, so normalized to 2024-01-01 as the default date. Then there's \"14.6 million in 2024\" which is the same year. Also, \"12-month period\" could be a duration, but since it's part of a phrase, maybe it's better to normalize as P12M. Wait, the user's previous example had \"P1Y\" for \"\u2013400 million infections occurring each year\". So maybe \"12-month period\" is P12M. But the exact text is \"12-month period\", so I should check if that's a duration. The instruction says to normalize durations to ISO 8601. So P12M would be correct. But I need to make sure if the text explicitly states a duration. The text says \"in recent decades\" but that's not a specific duration. The key temporal points are the years 2000 and 2024. The \"12-month period\" is part of the 2024 data, so maybe that's a duration. Let me note that.\n\nNext, spatial mentions. The text mentions \"Region of the Americas\" which is a region, parent region is \"Americas\" or maybe \"Region of the Americas\" itself? Wait, the parent region for \"Region of the Americas\" would be the continent, which is \"Americas\". But the text says \"Region of the Americas\" as a parent region. Wait, the user's previous example had \"Western Australia\" as the parent region for Broome. So in this case, \"Region of the Americas\" is a region, and the parent region would be \"Americas\" or maybe it's a specific region. But the text says \"Region of the Americas\" as part of the WHO report. So the location_type is \"region\" and parent_region is \"Americas\". Also, \"WHO\" is an organization, so maybe not a spatial. So the spatial entries would be \"Region of the Americas\" with location_type region and parent_region Americas.\n\nEvent_type: The text talks about the global burden of dengue, incidence, cases, deaths. The event_type could be \"surveillance_update\" since it's about reporting data and trends. The mention of \"global burden\" and \"incidence\" suggests surveillance data. So category \"surveillance_update\" with confidence 1.0.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention any specific venues like hospitals, clinics, etc. So venue_type array might be empty.\n\nDisease: The text clearly mentions \"dengue\" multiple times. The category is \"dengue\" and disease_code could be \"A91\" (ICD-10 code for dengue). But the user's schema requires disease_code as ICD-10 or SNOMED. Since the user didn't specify, I'll use \"A91\" as the code.\n\nNow, compiling all these into the JSON structure. Check each required field. For temporal, each entry needs text, normalized, and temporal_type. For spatial, text, location_type, and parent_region. Event_type needs text, category, confidence. Venue_type is empty here. Disease has text, category, disease_code.\n\nWait, the user's previous example had \"event_type\" with \"exposure_site\" and \"venue_type\" with \"hospital_emergency\". But in this text, there's no specific event like an outbreak or case report. The main focus is on the global data, so \"surveillance_update\" makes sense. The disease is dengue, so category is dengue. The temporal entries are 2000, 2024, and the 12-month period. The 12-month period is a duration, so normalized as P12M. The \"in 2024\" is a date, so normalized to 2024-01-01. The \"14.6 million in 2024\" is part of the same date. Also, the \"12 000 dengue-related deaths reported\" is part of the 2024 data. So the temporal entries would be:\n\n- \"in 2020\" \u2192 2020-01-01 (but the text says 2000 and 2024). Wait, the text says \"from 505 430 cases in 2000 to 14.6 million in 2024\". So the temporal entries are \"2000\" and \"2024\". Also, \"12-month period\" is a duration. So three temporal entries: 2000, 2024, and P12M.\n\nWait, the text says \"In 2024, more cases... recorded than ever before in a 12-month period\". So the 12-month period is part of 2024. So the duration is P12M. So the normalized for that would be P12M. So the temporal array would have three entries: 2000, 2024, and P12M.\n\nSo the JSON should have those entries. Let me structure that.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"in 2020\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2020-01-01\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"in 2024\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2024-01-01\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"12-month period\",\n      \"normalized\": \"P12M\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"duration\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Region of the Americas\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"Americas\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"global burden of dengue\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"dengue\",\n      \"category\": \"dengue\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"A91\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a text about dengue and wants the JSON extraction based on the specified schema. First, I need to parse the text and extract all the required fields: temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, and disease.\n\nStarting with temporal expressions. The text mentions \"From January to July 2025\" which is an interval. Using the previous reference that \"in 2024\" is normalized to 2024-01-01, so 2025 would be 2025-01-01. The interval would be from 2025-01-01 to 2025-07-31. Then there's \"In 2024\" which is a date, normalized to 2024-01-01. Also, \"390 million infections per year\" is a duration of P1Y. The \"last for 2\u20137 days\" from previous context might not be here, but the user's current text doesn't mention that. So temporal entries are the interval, the 2024 date, and the annual duration.\n\nNext, spatial mentions. The text refers to \"Region of the Americas\" which is a region, and \"European and Eastern Mediterranean regions\" as regions. Also, specific countries like France, Italy, Spain, Mayotte, and R\u00e9union. Mayotte and R\u00e9union are French overseas territories, so their parent region is France. The Region of the Americas is already mentioned in previous context, so maybe that's a parent region for other locations? Wait, the user's previous spatial references include \"Region of the Americas\" as a location already mentioned. So in the current text, \"European and Eastern Mediterranean regions\" are new, but the countries listed are part of those regions. So each country's parent region would be their respective region. For example, France is part of the European region, so Mayotte and R\u00e9union's parent region is France, which is in Europe. But the text says \"three European countries (France, Italy and Spain)\" so France's parent region is Europe. Similarly, Mayotte and R\u00e9union are in the French overseas territories, so their parent region is France. The \"Region of the Americas\" is already mentioned, so maybe that's a parent for other locations, but the text doesn't mention any new locations under that region. So spatial entries would include the regions and the specific countries with their parent regions.\n\nEvent_type: The text talks about cases reported to WHO, which is a surveillance update. The mention of factors associated with the spread is a risk warning. The \"d deaths reported\" might be a case report, but the exact text isn't clear. However, the main event here is the reporting of cases and deaths, which fits a surveillance update. Also, the spread to new areas could be an outbreak alert, but the text is more about reporting and factors, so maybe risk warning is better. Need to check the categories. Surveillance_update and risk_warning are possible. The \"d deaths reported\" could be a case_report, but the exact text isn't there. The user's previous example had \"exposure site\" but here it's about dengue cases. So event_type could be surveillance_update and risk_warning.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention any specific venues like hospitals or clinics. The transmission is through mosquito bites, so no venue. So venue_type array might be empty.\n\nDisease: The text clearly mentions dengue, so category is dengue. The disease_code isn't provided, but the schema requires it. Since it's not given, maybe leave it as empty or use a code. But the user's previous example had \"measles\" with code. Since the user hasn't provided codes, perhaps leave disease_code as empty or use a placeholder. However, the schema requires it, so maybe it's better to include an empty string or a code like \"A91\" for dengue. But without specific info, maybe just leave it as empty. Wait, the schema requires disease_code, so I need to include it. Since the user hasn't provided codes, perhaps use \"A91\" as the ICD-10 code for dengue. Alternatively, check if there's a standard code. Dengue is classified under ICD-10 as A91. So disease_code would be \"A91\".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have the temporal entries, spatial entries with regions and countries, event_type as surveillance_update and risk_warning, venue_type empty, and disease as dengue with code A91. Need to make sure all required fields are present and normalized correctly.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"From January to July 2025\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2025-01-01/2025-07-31\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"interval\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"In 2024\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2024-01-01\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"390 million infections per year\",\n      \"normalized\": \"P1Y\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"duration\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Region of the Americas\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"Global\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"European and Eastern Mediterranean regions\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"Global\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"France\",\n      \"location_type\": \"country\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"European region\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Italy\",\n      \"location_type\": \"country\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"European region\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Spain\",\n      \"location_type\": \"country\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"European region\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Mayotte\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"France\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"R\u00e9union\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"France\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Over 4 million cases and over 3000 deaths reported to WHO\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Dengue spreading to new areas\",\n      \"category\": \"risk_warning\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"dengue\",\n      \"category\": \"dengue\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"A91\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Other species within the Aedes genus can also act as vectors, but their contribution is normally secondary to Aedes aegypti.\n\nAfter feeding on a DENV-infected person, the virus replicates in the mosquito midgut before disseminating to secondary tissues, including the salivary glands. The time it takes from ingesting the virus to actual transmission to a new host is termed the extrinsic incubation period (EIP). The EIP takes about 8\u201312 days when the ambient temperature is 25\u201328\u00b0C. Variations in the EIP are not only influenced by ambient temperature but also by several other factors \u2013 such as the magnitude of daily temperature fluctuations, the virus genotype, and the initial viral concentration \u2013 which can also alter the time it takes for a mosquito to transmit the virus. Once infectious, a mosquito can transmit the virus for the rest of its life.\n\nHuman-to-mosquito transmission\n\nMosquitoes can become infected by people who are viremic with DENV. This can be someone who has a symptomatic dengue infection, someone who is yet to have a symptomatic infection (those who are pre-symptomatic), and also someone who shows no signs of illness (those who are asymptomatic).",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a text about dengue virus transmission and wants the JSON extraction based on the specified schema. \n\nFirst, I need to extract temporal expressions. The text mentions \"Transmission through the mosquito bite\" and talks about the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) taking 8\u201312 days at 25\u201328\u00b0C. There's no specific date mentioned, so maybe the temporal part is the duration. The EIP is a duration, so I should normalize that as P8D to P12D. But the user's previous example had a date, but here it's a duration. Wait, the schema allows duration as a temporal_type. So I'll note the EIP duration.\n\nNext, spatial references. The text mentions \"French overseas territories of Mayotte and R\u00e9union.\" These are regions, and their parent region is France. So each location is a region with parent_region as France. Also, the user's previous example included Mayotte and R\u00e9union in the spatial array, so I should follow that.\n\nFor event_type, the text is about transmission and how the virus spreads. The categories include surveillance_update or risk_warning. Since it's explaining transmission mechanisms, maybe surveillance_update? Or maybe other. The user's previous example had 'exposure_site' but here it's more about transmission, so perhaps 'surveillance_update' or 'risk_warning'. But the text doesn't mention an event like a report or alert, so maybe 'other' with confidence 0.5.\n\nVenue_type isn't mentioned here, so the array should be empty. \n\nDisease is clearly dengue, so category is dengue. The text mentions DENV, which is dengue virus, so the disease category is dengue. The disease_code could be B04.1 (ICD-10 for dengue).\n\nWait, the user's previous example had 'measles' but here it's dengue. So the disease array should have text 'dengue' and category 'dengue', disease_code as B04.1.\n\nPutting it all together: temporal with the EIP duration, spatial with Mayotte and R\u00e9union as regions under France, event_type as 'surveillance_update' or 'other'? The text is explaining transmission, which might be a surveillance update. But the allowed categories don't have 'transmission', so maybe 'other' with confidence 0.5. Alternatively, maybe 'risk_warning' if it's about transmission risks. But the text is more about how it's transmitted, not an alert. So 'other' seems safer.\n\nVenue_type is empty. Disease is dengue. So the JSON should reflect that.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) takes about 8\u201312 days\",\n      \"normalized\": \"P8D/P12D\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"duration\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"French overseas territories of Mayotte\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"France\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"R\u00e9union\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\",\n      \"parent_region\": \"France\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Transmission through the mosquito bite\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.8\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"dengue\",\n      \"category\": \"dengue\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"B04.1\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Most people are viremic for about 4\u20135 days, but viremia can last as long as 12 days.\n\nMaternal transmission\n\nThe primary mode of transmission of the DENV between humans involves mosquito vectors. There is evidence, however, of the possibility of maternal transmission (i.e. from a pregnant mother to her baby). At the same time, vertical transmission rates appear low, with the risk of vertical transmission seemingly linked to the timing of acquiring the dengue infection during pregnancy. When a mother does have a dengue infection when she is pregnant, babies may suffer from pre-term birth, low birthweight and fetal distress.\n\nOther transmission modes\n\nRare cases of transmission via blood products, organ donation and transfusions have been recorded. Similarly, transovarial transmission of the virus within mosquitoes has also been recorded.\n\nRisk factors\n\nPrevious infection with DENV increases the risk of an individual developing severe dengue.",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a text about dengue transmission and wants the JSON extraction based on the schema they specified. First, I need to parse the text and identify all the temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, and disease elements.\n\nStarting with temporal expressions. The text mentions \"4\u20135 days\" and \"12 days\" regarding viremia duration. These are durations, so I should normalize them to ISO 8601 format. \"4\u20135 days\" becomes P4D and P5D, but since it's a range, maybe P4D-P5D? Wait, the schema allows duration as a single value. The example in the previous response used P1D, so perhaps list both as separate entries. Also, \"2 days before\" and \"2 days after\" are durations. So I need to extract those as P2D.\n\nNext, spatial references. The text doesn't mention specific locations like cities or countries. It talks about mosquito vectors and transmission modes, but no specific places. So the spatial array might be empty.\n\nFor event_type, the text discusses transmission modes and risk factors. The primary mode is mosquito vectors, and there's mention of maternal transmission. However, the allowed categories don't include transmission modes. The closest might be \"risk_warning\" or \"surveillance_update\". But the text is more about explaining transmission rather than an event. Maybe \"other\" with confidence 0.5?\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention any specific venues like hospitals or clinics, so this array might be empty.\n\nDisease is clearly dengue, so the category is \"dengue\" with the text \"dengue\" and disease_code as \"B34.1\" (ICD-10 code for dengue fever). The user's previous example used \"measles\" with code \"B05\", so following that pattern.\n\nNow, checking the schema again. Temporal entries need text, normalized, and type. For durations, use P followed by the days. The text mentions \"4\u20135 days\" which is a range, but the schema might expect individual durations. So split into P4D and P5D. Also, \"2 days before\" and \"2 days after\" are durations of P2D. So three temporal entries.\n\nEvent_type: The text is informative but not an event. Maybe \"surveillance_update\" with confidence 0.8? Or \"risk_warning\" since it discusses risks. Alternatively, \"other\" with confidence 0.5. The previous example had \"exposure_site\" with confidence 1.0, but here it's more about transmission. Maybe \"other\" is safer.\n\nVenue_type: No venues mentioned, so empty array.\n\nDisease: Only dengue, so one entry with category \"dengue\" and code \"B34.1\".\n\nPutting it all together, ensuring all required fields are present. Check for any missed elements. The text also mentions \"vertical transmission\" and \"maternal transmission\", but those are part of the disease's transmission modes, not events. So no event_type entries except maybe \"risk_warning\" for the risk factors. But the user's schema might not have a category for that. So \"other\" with confidence 0.5.\n\nFinal check: temporal entries are durations, spatial is empty, event_type is \"other\", venue_type empty, disease is dengue.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"4\u20135 days\",\n      \"normalized\": \"P4D\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"duration\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"12 days\",\n      \"normalized\": \"P12D\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"duration\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"2 days before\",\n      \"normalized\": \"P2D\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"duration\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"2 days after\",\n      \"normalized\": \"P2D\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"duration\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"maternal transmission\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"dengue\",\n      \"category\": \"dengue\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"B34.1\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Routine vector surveillance and control activities and targeted community engagement greatly enhance resilience.\n\nVectors can adapt to new environments and climate. The interaction between the dengue virus, the host and the environment is dynamic. Consequently, disease risks may change and shift with climate change in tropical and subtropical areas, in combination with increased urbanization and population movement.\n\nPrevention and control\n\nThe mosquitoes that spread dengue are active during the day.\n\nTo lower your risk of getting dengue, protect yourself from mosquito bites by using:\n\nclothes that cover as much of your body as possible;\n\nmosquito nets, ideally sprayed with insect repellent, if sleeping during the day;\n\nwindow screens;\n\nmosquito repellents (containing DEET, Picaridin or IR3535); and\n\ncoils and vaporizers.\n\nTo prevent mosquitoes from breeding:",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a text about dengue risk factors and prevention, and they want me to extract specific information into JSON based on the schema they provided.\n\nFirst, I need to check for temporal expressions. The text mentions \"mosquitoes that spread dengue are active during the day.\" But there's no specific date, time, or duration mentioned here. So the temporal array might be empty. Wait, the user's previous example had a date, but this text doesn't have any. So I'll leave temporal as an empty array.\n\nNext, spatial references. The text doesn't mention any specific locations like cities or countries. It talks about general things like urbanization and population density, but no specific places. So spatial array is also empty.\n\nFor event_type, the text discusses risk factors and prevention, which doesn't fit into the categories like exposure_site or outbreak_alert. It's more about general information, so event_type might be \"other\" with low confidence. But the user's schema requires categories from the enum. Since there's no clear event type, maybe it's better to leave it empty or use \"other\" with confidence 0. But the previous example had \"exposure_site\" even without a specific location. Wait, the user's previous response included \"exposure_site\" even when the text didn't mention a specific site. But in this case, the text is about risk factors, not an event. So maybe event_type is empty.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention any specific venues like hospitals or clinics. It's about general prevention measures, so venue_type is empty.\n\nDisease: The text clearly mentions \"dengue,\" which is one of the allowed categories. So I'll extract that with category \"dengue\" and a disease_code. The ICD-10 code for dengue is A90-A91, but the user might expect just the category. Since the schema requires disease_code, maybe leave it as empty or use a placeholder. But the example in the previous response had \"measles\" with code \"B05\" (though that's not correct, but maybe the user expects it). Alternatively, since the code isn't provided, perhaps omit it. Wait, the schema says \"disease_code\" is required. So I need to include it. But the user's example had \"measles\" with code \"B05\", which is correct. For dengue, the ICD-10 code is A90-A91. So I'll use \"A90\" as the code.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have disease with text \"dengue\", category \"dengue\", and disease_code \"A90\". The rest are empty arrays. Let me double-check the schema requirements. All other fields are optional, so they can be omitted. The user's previous response included some fields even if they were empty, but in this case, the text doesn't have the necessary info for those fields. So the final JSON should have only the disease entry.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"dengue\",\n      \"category\": \"dengue\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"A90\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The user provided a text about dengue prevention and WHO response, and they want the information extracted into a specific JSON format. \n\nFirst, I need to check for temporal expressions. The text doesn't mention any dates, times, or durations. So the temporal array will be empty.\n\nNext, spatial references. The text talks about \"domestic water storage containers\" and mentions \"countries\" in the context of the vaccine. But there's no specific location name. So maybe the spatial array will have entries for \"countries\" as a parent region, but since there's no specific city or region named, perhaps it's not included. Wait, the user's previous example had Broome, Western Australia. Here, the text doesn't specify any particular location, so maybe spatial is empty.\n\nFor event_type, the text discusses prevention measures and WHO's response. The categories include risk_warning, surveillance_update, and maybe outbreak_alert. But the text doesn't mention a specific event like a case report or outbreak. The WHO response might fall under surveillance_update or risk_warning. However, the user's example had \"exposure_site\" with confidence 1.0. Here, since it's general advice, maybe event_type is \"risk_warning\" with confidence 0.8 or something. But the user's schema requires \"text\" and \"category\" and \"confidence\". The text mentions \"WHO responds to dengue by...\" which could be a surveillance_update. But I'm not sure. Maybe \"risk_warning\" as a general advisory.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention any specific venues like hospitals or clinics. So venue_type array is empty.\n\nDisease: The text clearly mentions \"dengue\" multiple times. So the disease category is \"dengue\" with confidence 1.0. The disease_code could be \"A17\" as per ICD-10 for dengue.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have disease with \"dengue\" and the other fields empty. Let me check the schema again. The required fields for disease are text, category, disease_code. So I need to include those. The other fields like temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type can be empty arrays if there's no data. \n\nWait, the user's previous example had event_type and venue_type even if they were not applicable. But in this case, the text doesn't mention any specific events or venues. So those arrays will be empty. The disease is clearly mentioned, so that's filled in. \n\nI think that's all. Let me structure the JSON accordingly.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"WHO responds to dengue by supporting countries in outbreak confirmation and providing technical advice\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.9\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"dengue\",\n      \"category\": \"dengue\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"A17\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a block of text about dengue management and wants the JSON extraction as per the schema. First, I need to parse the text for temporal, spatial, event_type, venue_type, and disease categories.\n\nLooking at the text, there's a mention of \"April 2025\" in the reference for laboratory testing. That's a date, so I'll normalize it to \"2025-04\" as a date. The other dates in the references are 2013 and 2025, but the main temporal info here is April 2025.\n\nFor spatial, the text mentions \"over 100 Member States,\" but the schema requires specific locations. Since the text doesn't specify particular countries or cities, maybe \"Member States\" is too vague. However, the user's previous example included \"Western Australia\" as a parent region. Here, \"Member States\" might be considered a region, but the schema's location_type includes \"country\" and \"region.\" Since it's not a specific place, perhaps it's \"other\" or \"country\" if assuming they're countries. But the text doesn't specify, so maybe no spatial entries? Wait, the user's previous example had \"Broome, Western Australia\" as a city with parent region. Here, the text doesn't have specific locations, so maybe spatial is empty? Or maybe \"Member States\" is a region. Hmm, but the schema requires \"text\" and \"location_type.\" Since the text is \"over 100 Member States,\" maybe that's a region, but it's unclear. Maybe no spatial entries here.\n\nEvent_type: The text talks about supporting countries, strategies, policies, etc. The main event here is about dengue management activities. The allowed categories include \"surveillance_update\" or \"risk_warning.\" Since it's about strategies and policies, maybe \"surveillance_update\" with confidence 0.8. Or \"other\" if none fit. The user's previous example had \"exposure_site\" and \"case_report.\" Here, the activities are more about guidelines and strategies, so maybe \"surveillance_update\" as the event type.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention specific venues like hospitals or clinics. So venue_type might be empty.\n\nDisease: The text repeatedly mentions dengue, so the category is \"dengue\" with confidence 1.0. The disease_code could be \"A91\" (ICD-10 for dengue).\n\nPutting it all together: temporal has \"April 2025\" as a date. Spatial might be empty or \"Member States\" as a region. Event_type is \"surveillance_update.\" Venue_type is empty. Disease is \"dengue.\"\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"April 2025\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2025-04\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"supporting countries to improve their reporting systems...\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.8\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"dengue\",\n      \"category\": \"dengue\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"A91\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

        "raw_llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a block of text related to WHO publications and dengue. They want me to extract specific information into JSON based on the schema they provided.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the text for temporal expressions. The dates mentioned are April 2025, 10 July 2025, 22 May 2025, 3 October 2024, 14 April 2025, 11 December 2024, 26 September 2024, and some dates in the news section. Since the document context's current position is Chunk 12 of 12, and the previous temporal references include April 2025 as 2025-04, I should normalize all dates to ISO format. For example, \"April 2025\" becomes \"2025-04\". The dates without specific months like \"3 October 2024\" would be \"2024-10-03\". I'll list each date as a separate temporal entry.\n\nNext, spatial references. The text mentions regions like Africa, Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, South-East Asia, Western Pacific. These are all regions, so their location_type should be \"region\" and parent_region would be \"World\" or maybe leave parent_region empty since they are global regions. However, the previous spatial references include France, Italy, Mayotte, R\u00e9union. But in this text, there are no specific cities or countries mentioned, just regions. So I'll list each region as a spatial entry with location_type \"region\" and parent_region as \"World\" if applicable, but maybe just the region name without parent_region if not specified.\n\nFor event_type, the text includes \"interim guidance\", \"questions and answers\", \"global surveillance dashboard\", \"fact sheets\", \"feature stories\", \"policies\", etc. These don't directly map to the event categories like outbreak_alert or case_report. The closest might be \"surveillance_update\" for the dashboard and \"risk_warning\" for guidelines. But since the user's example had \"exposure_site\" and others, I need to check if any of the text mentions events. The \"feature stories\" might be \"other\" category. However, the user's example had \"exposure_site\" but in this case, there's no specific event mentioned. So maybe \"surveillance_update\" for the dashboard and \"risk_warning\" for the guidelines. But I need to be cautious here. The \"WHO launches global strategic plan\" could be a \"surveillance_update\" or \"outbreak_alert\"? Maybe \"surveillance_update\" is more appropriate. The \"news\" section might be \"other\". I'll have to assign categories based on the closest match.\n\nVenue_type: The text doesn't mention any specific venues like hospitals or clinics. The \"Margaret River Emergency Department\" was in the previous example, but this text doesn't have that. So venue_type might be empty or \"other\" if there's a mention. But since there's no venue mentioned, maybe skip this section.\n\nDisease: The text repeatedly mentions \"dengue\" and other arboviral diseases like chikungunya, Zika, yellow fever. So the disease category would be \"dengue\" with text \"dengue\" and category \"dengue\". Also, other diseases like chikungunya are mentioned, but the user's schema allows \"other\" for disease. However, the main focus is on dengue, so I'll list \"dengue\" as the primary disease. The other diseases might be under \"other\" if not specified. But the user's example had \"measles\" as a category, so I need to check if the schema allows for multiple entries. The disease array can have multiple entries, so I'll include dengue, chikungunya, Zika, yellow fever, and maybe others as \"other\".\n\nNow, putting it all together. Temporal entries for each date, spatial for regions, event_type for the WHO activities, and disease for the mentioned illnesses. Need to ensure all required fields are present and the JSON is valid. Also, check for confidence scores where applicable, but since the user's example had confidence 1.0, maybe set that for all entries unless unsure. However, for event_type, if the category is not certain, the confidence might be lower, but in this case, the text is explicit about the WHO activities, so confidence can be 1.0.\n\nWait, the user's previous example had \"event_type\" with \"exposure_site\" and \"venue_type\" with \"hospital_emergency\". In this case, the text doesn't mention any specific events or venues, so event_type and venue_type might be empty. But the user's schema requires them to be arrays, so they can be empty. However, the user's example included them even if they were not applicable. Wait, looking back, the user's previous response had event_type and venue_type even when the text didn't mention them. Wait, no, in the previous example, the user's input was about a cyclone hitting Broome, and the assistant included event_type as \"exposure_site\" and venue_type as \"hospital_emergency\", but that might have been a mistake. Wait, the user's input was \"a cyclone hit Broome, Western Australia\" and the assistant's response included event_type as \"exposure_site\" and venue_type as \"hospital_emergency\", which doesn't make sense. That might be an error. But the user is now providing a new input, so I need to follow the schema strictly.\n\nIn the current input, there's no mention of events or venues, so event_type and venue_type arrays would be empty. However, the user's schema requires them to be arrays, so they can be empty. But the user's example had entries even when not applicable. Wait, the user's previous example had entries, but maybe that was a mistake. However, the user's current query is to extract based on the schema, so I need to follow the schema. So for this input, since there are no events or venues mentioned, those arrays would be empty. But the user's schema allows for \"other\" in event_type. Let me check the text again.\n\nThe text includes \"WHO launches global strategic plan to fight rising dengue and other Aedes-borne arboviral diseases 3 October 2024\" \u2013 this could be a \"surveillance_update\" or \"risk_warning\". Similarly, \"New WHO guidelines for clinical management of arboviral diseases: dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever 10 July 2025\" \u2013 this is a guideline, which might be a \"surveillance_update\" or \"risk_warning\". The \"Dengue Expert Review Panel for Diagnostics 22 May 2025\" \u2013 this is a review panel, which might be a \"surveillance_update\". The \"Global dengue surveillance dashboard\" could be a \"surveillance_update\". The \"Fact sheets\" might be \"surveillance_update\" or \"other\". The \"Feature stories\" could be \"other\". The \"Policies\" section might be \"other\".\n\nSo for event_type, I can categorize some entries as \"surveillance_update\" and others as \"other\". For example:\n\n- \"Global dengue surveillance dashboard\" \u2192 \"surveillance_update\"\n- \"New WHO guidelines...\" \u2192 \"surveillance_update\" or \"risk_warning\"\n- \"WHO launches global strategic plan...\" \u2192 \"surveillance_update\"\n- \"Dengue Expert Review Panel...\" \u2192 \"surveillance_update\"\n- \"Fact sheets\" \u2192 \"surveillance_update\"\n- \"Feature stories\" \u2192 \"other\"\n\nBut the user's schema requires confidence scores. Since the text is explicit, I can set confidence to 1.0 for these. However, the user's example had confidence 1.0 for all entries, so I'll follow that.\n\nFor disease, the text mentions dengue, chikungunya, Zika, yellow fever. So:\n\n- \"dengue\" \u2192 category \"dengue\"\n- \"chikungunya\" \u2192 category \"other\" (since it's not in the allowed list? Wait, the allowed categories for disease include \"dengue\", \"chikungunya\" is not listed. Wait, looking back at the schema:\n\nThe disease categories are:\n- measles\n- influenza\n- covid19\n- pertussis\n- meningococcal\n- hepatitis\n- gastroenteritis\n- dengue\n- ross_river_virus\n- other\n\nSo chikungunya, Zika, yellow fever are not in the allowed categories. Therefore, they should be categorized as \"other\". So the disease entries would be:\n\n- \"dengue\" \u2192 category \"dengue\"\n- \"chikungunya\" \u2192 category \"other\"\n- \"Zika\" \u2192 category \"other\"\n- \"yellow fever\" \u2192 category \"other\"\n\nBut the text also mentions \"arboviral diseases\" which includes dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and yellow fever. So the disease entries would be \"dengue\" and others as \"other\".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would have temporal entries for each date, spatial entries for the regions, event_type entries for the WHO activities, and disease entries for dengue and others.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"temporal\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"dengue virus: interim guidance, April 2025\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2025-04\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"New WHO guidelines for clinical management of arboviral diseases: dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever 10 July 2025\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2025-07-10\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Dengue Expert Review Panel for Diagnostics 22 May 2025\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2025-05-22\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"WHO launches global strategic plan to fight rising dengue and other Aedes-borne arboviral diseases 3 October 2024\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2024-10-03\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Chikungunya 14 April 2025\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2025-04-14\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Malaria 11 December 2024\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2024-12-11\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Vector-borne diseases 26 September 2024\",\n      \"normalized\": \"2024-09-26\",\n      \"temporal_type\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"spatial\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Africa\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Americas\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Eastern Mediterranean\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Europe\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"South-East Asia\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Western Pacific\",\n      \"location_type\": \"region\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"event_type\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"WHO launches global strategic plan to fight rising dengue and other Aedes-borne arboviral diseases 3 October 2024\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"New WHO guidelines for clinical management of arboviral diseases: dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever 10 July 2025\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Dengue Expert Review Panel for Diagnostics 22 May 2025\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Global dengue surveillance dashboard\",\n      \"category\": \"surveillance_update\",\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"venue_type\": [],\n  \"disease\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"dengue\",\n      \"category\": \"dengue\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"chikungunya\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Zika\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"yellow fever\",\n      \"category\": \"other\",\n      \"disease_code\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
